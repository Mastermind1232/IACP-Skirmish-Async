# IA Skirmish Rules Reference

**Source:** FFG Skirmish Guide + IACP Official Changes (v10.2.2). IACP takes priority when rules conflict.

## Core Loop
1. **Setup** → Initiative, map, deployment, draw 3 command cards
2. **Activation Phase** → Alternate activating deployment groups (initiative player first). Both players end activation when done.
3. **Status Phase** — in order: (1) Ready all Deployment cards; (2) Draw 1 CC + 1 per controlled terminal; (3) End of round effects (scoring); (4) Pass initiative
4. Repeat until 40 VP or one player eliminated

## Army Building
- **Deployment:** ≤40 points, same affiliation, limits: 1 unique, 2 elite, 4 regular per name
- **Command deck:** Exactly 15 cards, ≤15 total cost, obey card limit icons
- **Skirmish upgrades:** Optional, no figure, can enable multi-affiliation

## Victory
- **40 VP** to win immediately
- **Elimination:** All figures defeated = instant loss
- **VP sources:** Defeating figures (cost = VP), mission objectives, card effects

## Key Rules (Skirmish vs Campaign)
- **Strain:** No strain in Skirmish. If a card would inflict strain, the **receiving figure's player** chooses: **1 damage** OR **discard top card of their CC deck**
- No resting
- One attack per activation (including special-action attacks)
- Heroes use Deployment cards, not hero sheets; function like normal figures
- No supply cards/crates

## Initiative
- Lower total deployment cost chooses who starts with initiative
- Tie = random
- Initiative player: picks deployment zone (red or blue), activates first each round
- Passes to opponent each Status Phase

## Terminals
- Player controls terminal if only they have a figure on or adjacent
- +1 command card draw per controlled terminal (Status Phase step 2)

## Figure Size Traits (for effects)
- **Default:** If a DC does not explicitly have LARGE or MASSIVE, it is considered **SMALL** for all effects (command cards, abilities, etc.).
- **LARGE:** 1x2 or 2x2 footprint (or explicit Large keyword in dc-keywords.json)
- **MASSIVE:** 2x3 footprint or explicit Massive keyword
- **SMALL:** 1x1 footprint or unknown DC

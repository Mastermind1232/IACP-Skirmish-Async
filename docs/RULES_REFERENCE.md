# Star Wars: Imperial Assault — Rules Reference

**Sources:** The Consolidated Star Wars: Imperial Assault™ Rules (Pasi, v1.4) and **IACP Official Changes (v10.2.2)**. When rules conflict, **IACP takes priority**.

---

NOTES FROM PASI (V1.4)
Things may have gotten a little out of hand. I first meant to offer a few edits to clean up the few inconsistencies
and omissions of the Rules Reference Guide. Then I thought about adding annotations to the parts that required
that, but got sidetracked and consolidated all of the rules from the various expansion campaign rulebooks,
rulesheets, and the latest FAQ (and some known rulings). Later on there may be more in-depth chapters about
various things that new players tend to misunderstand or find hard to get right.
The sections where I have taken more liberties in explaining the current best knowledge without it being
directly derivable from the FAQ and public rulings are indicated with purple text. Take these with grain of salt
before official rulings, and view them more as how I would rule them on the spot.
This document is now gender-agnostic, so a lot of the text is not word for word from the original rules.

## INTRODUCTION

"I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found." – Leia Organa, A New Hope
"We have hope; hope that things can get better. And they will." – Hera Syndulla, Star Wars: Rebels
Star Wars © & ™ Lucasfilm Ltd.
Star Wars: Imperial Assault © Fantasy Flight Games
This guide integrates the rules from Imperial Assault rulebooks and is updated with information from the latest
FAQ, known rulings, and from discussions between the technical editor(s) and the Imperial Assault
development team. This document aims to represent the best current knowledge of the game. For situations
where it matters, you should consult the original text of Rules Reference Guide, the corresponding expansion
rulebook or rulesheet, the latest FAQ, and/or the Skirmish Tournament Rules.
Most rules in this guide apply whether playing campaign, skirmish, or with the Legends of the Alliance app.
Any rules that apply to only one or the other are labeled with "during a campaign" or "during a skirmish."
Integrating detailed Legends of the Alliance app information is under consideration.
Page numbers (outside of the Index) are links for quick jumping around the document.

## GOLDEN RULES

Card abilities can override the rules listed in this guide. Mission rules can override both card abilities and rules
from this guide. If a card or mission uses the word cannot, that effect is absolute and cannot be overridden by
other effects.

## TIMING

Numerous game effects have the possibility of triggering at the same time. If this occurs, use the following to
determine the order in which these effects are resolved:
In a campaign, outside of attacks, resolve mission rules first, followed by effects triggered by the Imperial
player, then effects triggered by Rebel players.
In a skirmish, outside of attacks, resolve mission rules first, followed by effects triggered by the player with
initiative, then effects triggered by their opponent.
During an attack, in both a campaign and a skirmish, resolve mission rules first, followed by effects triggered
by the attacker, then effects triggered by the defender.
For additional information on timing conflicts, see "Conflicts" on page 22.


## GAME MODES

Star Wars: Imperial Assault is three games in one – a 1 vs many campaign game, a skirmish game, and a
solo/cooperative campaign game using the Legends of the Alliance companion app.

## CAMPAIGN

The campaign game allows up to five players to enter the Star Wars universe through a narrative story
composed of linked missions. One player commands the armed forces of the Galactic Empire, while up to four
others play as heroes of the Rebellion, engaging in covert operations and missions. Both the forces of the
Empire and the Rebel heroes gain new skills and items throughout the campaign, allowing characters to
develop and grow as the story unfolds.
In addition to having a choice of different rebel hero characters and Imperial options, the structure of branching
story missions and interleaved side missions allow the same campaign to be played more than once and get a
different experience. The core game contains one campaign, the boxed expansions provide additional
campaigns (full or minicampaigns).
Each Campaign (p.17) consists of Campaign Setup (p.18), after which the players follow the corresponding
campaign log to see which mission or type of mission to play next (Mission Stage p.46). The campaign log also
shows when to perform Rebel Upgrade Stage (p.52) and Imperial Upgrade Stage (p.35) to purchase new
abilities and useful items. The Campaign log can be found from the back of the campaign book/rulebook of the
boxed expansion. Campaign logs can also be found from FFG Star Wars: Imperial Assault product page under
Player Resources.

## SKIRMISH

Star Wars: Imperial Assault offers a completely distinct game experience in the skirmish game. Skirmish
missions allow two players to compete in head-to-head, tactical combat. You’ll muster your own teams of
Imperial, Rebel, and Mercenary forces (Army Building p.9), and build decks of Command cards (p.20), which
you can play to gain an unexpected advantage. Each skirmish mission has its own objectives. Whether you
recover lost holocrons, or battle to defeat a raiding party, you’ll find danger and tense, tactical choices in every
skirmish.
There are also a number of maps in the various expansions to play 4-player skirmish missions in free-for-all
and team play modes.
See “Skirmish” p.55, “Four-Player Skirmishes” p.32.

## LEGENDS OF THE ALLIANCE COMPANION APP

Legends of the Alliance is a free companion app for Imperial Assault providing a third way to play the game.
The Legends of the Alliance app replaces the role of the Imperial player, freeing you and your friends to unite
against the Galactic Empire for a cooperative or solo experience.
Currently Legends of the Alliance contains two campaigns:
- The Flight of the Freedom Fighter introductory campaign (only the core game required to play), and
- Jabba's Realm campaign (the core box and the physical Jabba's Realm expansion required to play).
- Return to Hoth campaign (the core box and the physical Return to Hoth expansion required to play).
The Legends of the Alliance also contains two raid missions: The Malastarian Outpost and Gray Cap Cantina.
In addition to having specific app-related rules, some rules are different in the app than in the campaign and
skirmish games. You can find the Legends of the Alliance rulebook from FFG Star Wars: Imperial Assault
under the Rules section.

## GLOSSARY

This section lists rules for Imperial Assault in alphabetical order. Each entry lists the basic rule first, followed
by a list of exceptions and additional details.

## ABILITIES

All text on cards and hero sheets are referred to as abilities. Abilities can have one or more requirements which
must be met. Most abilities have an explicit or implicit timing or trigger condition. Abilities can be mandatory
or optional. Abilities that contain “may”, “use”, or require paying a cost to activate are optional. Being able to
perform all effects of an ability is not required to be able to activate the ability unless explicitly specified. If any
or all parts of the ability cannot be performed, you perform as much as you can.
- If an ability is "used," it can be triggered multiple times each round, but all abilities can only be triggered
once per timing instance. For example, an ability that says, "Use while attacking to apply +1 to the attack
results," it can only be triggered once during each attack. (See the timing of abilities that use “while
attacking” or “while defending” from “Special Situations Regarding Attacks” on page 12.)
- Some abilities have costs which must be paid in order to resolve the ability. Ability costs include, but are
not limited to:
- : Special action - this ability requires spending an action per each special action symbol listed.
- : A surge () result must be spent during an attack (5. Spend Surges step) to use this ability.
- : A hero voluntarily suffers the listed amount of  (strain) without exceeding their endurance in
order to use this ability. Other figures don't have endurance and can voluntarily suffer a strain cost to
activate an ability, and suffer the strain cost as damage instead (in a skirmish each damage suffered this
way can be cancelled by discarding a command card from the command card deck). See “Strain” p.58.
- : These abilities appear in the campaign. The Imperial player must spend the listed amount of 
(“Threat” p.60) to use this ability.
- Exhaust: The player must exhaust (p.30) the card to use this ability.
- Deplete: The player must deplete (p.25) the card to use this ability.
- Discard / Play: The card or a specified token needs to be discarded to use the ability. In a Skirmish,
usually using an ability on a command card (p.20) requires it to be played as part of its cost.
- VP: In a skirmish some abilities require to spend or pay (p.50) Victory Points (p.62).
- A figure can perform each special action ability (denoted by ) only once per activation.
- An ability that can be used "during your activation" (p.28) can be used before or after performing an action
during an activation. Abilities that can be used "during your activation" are not interrupting abilities unless
otherwise specified, and thus cannot be used while resolving another ability.
- Many abilities can trigger from the same event in the game. The decisions to use abilities with the same
trigger condition are performed in the timing conflict resolution order (p.22). The cost of each ability is
paid just before it is resolved.
- An ability that causes one or more figures to suffer damage (such as Darth Vader's "Force Choke") is not
considered to be an attack and does not count toward a figure's attack limitations.
- Abilities that have per-activation limits (for example: "limit once per activation") cannot be used outside of
an activation.

## ABILITIES BOX

The abilities box is the portion of a Companion, Deployment, or Form card that includes keywords, passive
abilities, and surge abilities.
Related Topics: Companions 21, Deployment Cards 26, Form Cards 31, Text Box 60

## ACCURACY

Ranged attacks () need enough Accuracy to not miss the target (“Miss” p. 42). The amount of Accuracy
needed is equal to the number of spaces the attacker is away from the target ("Counting Spaces" p. 23).
- The attacker's total Accuracy is determined by adding all accuracy results from dice, and applying any
Accuracy modifiers provided by abilities and conditions.
- While attacking an adjacent figure or object with a ranged attack, the attacker needs at least 1 Accuracy.
This also applies to attacking a Companion in the same space. (A Companion is defined to be adjacent to
objects and figures in the same space.) Attacking an object in the same spage requires 0 accuracy.
Related Topics: Attacks 10, Counting Spaces 23, Line of Sight 40, Miss 42

## ACTIONS

During a figure's activation, it may perform two actions. The available actions are Attack, Move, Interact, Rest
(only heroes can rest). In addition, a figure may have access to one or more Special actions.
- The figure is not required to perform both actions.
- Each action must be resolved completely before the figure performs its next action.
- Special actions are denoted on components by the  icon. If an ability has two  icons, the ability is
considered to be one action, but it costs the figure two of its actions to resolve.
- When a special action () contains multiple attacks, or a move and an attack, it still only requires the
listed number of actions to perform.
- Movement points can be spent before or after performing an action. If movement points are gained as part
of a special action, they must be spent during that action.
- A figure can perform the same action multiple times during the same activation except as follows:
- A non-hero figure can use only one of its actions to perform an attack per activation. This includes
special actions that contain one or more attacks. (In the Legends of the Alliance co-op campaign app,
imperial activation instructions use the  attack action symbol to denote actions that contain attacks.)
- A figure can perform each special action () only once per activation.
- In the Legends of the Alliance companion app actions presented on screen with the action arrow  are not
considered special actions, and are not limited to once per activation unless otherwise indicated.
- Numerous game effects allow figures to perform an attack, rest, interact, or perform a move without
performing an action.

## ACTIVATION

During each Activation Phase, each figure receives one activation. During a figure's activation, it performs up
to two actions.
- Players alternate resolving activations. When resolving an activation, a player chooses one ready friendly
group to activate. After a player finishes resolving an activation, one of their opponents then resolves an
activation.
- While activating a group of two or more figures, the player activates all figures in the group in the order of
their choice. The player resolves two actions for each figure in that group before their opponent resolves an
activation. The player must resolve both actions for each figure before activating the next figure.


- During a campaign:
- The Rebel players perform the first activation of each round.
- When it is their opportunity to resolve an activation, the Rebel players choose which ready Rebel group
will activate.
- A hero can suffer 1 (strain) during their activation to gain 1 movement point. The hero may do this
up to twice per activation.
- If a hero has two activation tokens (when playing with less than 4 heroes), the hero cannot resolve their
second activation until after each hero has resolved its first activation.
- Each hero readies all of their exhausted cards at the start of their activation.
- In a three-hero game, Rebel players choose one hero to claim a second activation token at the end of
each round. In a two-hero game, each hero has two activation tokens. (“Campaign Setup” p.18)
- After performing up to two actions and the applicable “during your activation” abilities, such as spending
the remaining movement points, a figure declares the end of its activation. A player may choose to end a
figure's activation without performing both actions or spending all of its movement points. Remaining
actions and unspent movement points do not carry over to a figure's next activation.
- After resolving a group's activation, exhaust the hero's activation token (for heroes) or Deployment card
(for all other groups). After activating a Companion exhaust the Companion card.
- If all friendly groups are exhausted, that player cannot perform an activation. The player's opponent(s)
continue to resolve activations until all groups are exhausted.
- Abilities that can be used during a figure's activation are used before or after either of that figure's two
actions but not while performing actions or other abilities.

## ACTIVATION PHASE

The first phase of each round is the Activation Phase. During this phase, players alternate activating groups of
figures until all groups are exhausted. When resolving an activation, a player chooses one ready friendly group
to activate.
- While activating a group of two or more figures, the player activates all figures in the group, one at a time,
in the order of their choice.
- During a campaign mission, Rebel and Imperial players alternate activating groups. The Rebel players
resolve the first activation each round.
- During a skirmish, players alternate activating groups, starting with the player with initiative each round. In
Four-Player Skirmishes (p.32), each player in clockwise order activates one of their ready groups.
- During a skirmish, if a player has fewer ready Deployment cards than any of their opponents, that player
may choose not to activate a group and pass play back to their opponent.

## ACTIVE MISSIONS

During a campaign, an active mission is any available story mission, side mission, or threat mission that the
heroes can choose to resolve.
Missions can become active from campaign setup, as the result of a resolved mission, the imperial player
purchasing an agenda mission card, or when a replacement is drawn after resolving a side mission which had
been drawn from the side mission deck.
Related Topics: Campaign Setup 18, Missions 43


## ADJACENT

A space is adjacent to each other space that shares an edge or corner with the space.
- Two spaces that share only an edge that is a wall, blocking terrain, or a door are not adjacent.
- A figure is not considered to be adjacent to itself.
- Two figures that are in adjacent spaces are adjacent figures. These figures are one space away from each
other. A  (ranged) attack targeting an adjacent figure needs at least 1 Accuracy to not miss.
- Spaces on either side of the diagonal intersection of walls, doors, and/or blocking terrain are not adjacent to
each other (see example #16 in "Appendix I - Line of Sight Examples" p.65).
- A space that is blocking terrain is not adjacent to any other space.
- If occupying blocking terrain, a figure or object which is distance 1 from another figure, object, or a space
is adjacent even when the space it occupies is not. (“Counting Spaces” p.23, “Blocking Terrain” p.15.)

## AFFILIATION

Each figure belongs to one of three affiliations:  (Rebel),  (Imperial), or  (Mercenary). All heroes are 
figures, while each other figure's affiliation is shown on the upper-right corner of its Deployment card.
- During a campaign,  and  figures are friendly to one another and hostile toward the  figures. All 
figures are friendly to each other and hostile toward all  and  figures.
- During a campaign, all figures controlled by the Imperial player (both  and  affiliations) are “Imperial
figures” (when spelled in full).
- During a campaign, if the rebel players gain an ally that has the  (Imperial) or  (Mercenary) affiliation,
that ally loses that affiliation and is considered a  (Rebel) for as long as it is an ally.
- During a skirmish, all of a player's Deployment cards must have the same affiliation. All figures belonging
to that player are friendly to each other, while all figures belonging to their opponent are hostile toward
their figures.
- Deployment cards with  (Neutral) icon and card back do not belong to any affiliation. When creating an
army (p.9) for a skirmish, a player may choose to include Neutral Deployment cards as if they belonged to
their affiliation.
- A companion (p.21) shares the affiliation of the group it is associated with.
- If an ability uses the affiliation symbol (, , or ), it only applies to figures of the matching affiliation.

## AGENDA CARDS

During a campaign, the Imperial player can purchase Agenda cards. These cards have a wide range of powerful
abilities and are usually discarded after use.
- The Imperial player can purchase Agenda cards by spending influence during the Imperial Upgrade Stage.
- During campaign setup, the Imperial player builds their Agenda deck by choosing six sets of Agenda cards
(see "Building the Agenda Deck" on page 7).
- During Jabba's Realm and Heart of the Empire campaigns, and the Tyrants of Lothal mini campaign, the
Imperial player may only have a total of four Agenda cards between their hand and their play area. If, at the
end of an Imperial Upgrade Stage, the imperial player has more than four Agenda cards, cards must be
discarded until there are four. This rule can also be used for any campaign.
- When an Agenda card is discarded, it is returned to the game box and not used for the rest of the campaign.
- The ability text of an Agenda card can allow the Imperial player to shuffle the card back into the Agenda
deck instead of discarding it.


## TYPES OF AGENDA CARDS

There are different types of Agenda cards:
- Side Mission: Some Agenda cards are played as side missions. After purchasing one of these cards, follow
its instructions to place it faceup on the table; it is now an active side mission. This Agenda card is kept
with the active missions between sessions. Discard the card after the mission is resolved or follow its
instructions after a different side mission (or threat mission) has been resolved.
- Forced Mission: Some Agenda cards force players to resolve a specific mission. After purchasing one of
these cards, players immediately resolve the listed mission and then discard the Agenda card.
- Ongoing: Some Agenda cards are placed in the Imperial player's play area after purchasing. These cards
have an ongoing effect and remain in play until discarded by another effect. These Agenda cards are kept
with the Imperial player's components between sessions.
- Kept Secret: If the card says "keep this card secret" the Imperial player keeps the card hidden from the
Rebel players. The imperial player resolves the effect at a later point in the campaign as instructed on the
card. These Agendas are kept with the Imperial player's components between sessions until chosen to be
resolved. These cards may cost additional influence when resolved.
- Immediate: Some Agenda cards are put into play immediately when purchased and are discarded after the
next mission has been resolved.

## BUILDING THE AGENDA DECK

During campaign setup, the Imperial player chooses six sets of Agenda cards and shuffles them together to
create their Agenda deck for the campaign.
- Each Agenda set consists of three cards. The card's set is written on the upper right corner of the card.
- The Imperial player cannot choose an Agenda set if it contains a card with a listed time period range that
does not include the time period of the campaign.
- An Agenda's set is only used for building the deck at the start of a campaign and has no other game effect.
- All Agenda cards not chosen during campaign setup are returned to the game box and are not used during
this campaign.

Upgrade Stage 35, Time Period 61

## ALLIES

During a campaign, players can gain access to special groups as mission rewards. These figures are collectively
referred to as allies.
- All figures corresponding to Rebel Deployment cards are allies. Figures corresponding to unique Imperial
( or ) Deployment cards (such as "Darth Vader") are villains. Villains follow all general ally rules
listed in this section.
- Allies (and villains) cannot be used in a mission until claimed as a reward or granted by another game
effect.
- Allies follow all rules for other figures that have Deployment cards. The ally is considered to be friendly to
any other figures controlled by that player and other friendly figures.
- When an ally is defeated, it is removed from the map and cannot be redeployed for the remainder of the
mission. The ally may be used in future missions following normal rules.
- Certain missions can feature allies who have no corresponding Deployment card. These allies activate
during the round as normal. Mark the figure with a strain token when it has activated and discard the token
during the Ready step of the Status phase.
- In the core game, allies are represented by tokens instead of plastic figures. The art on each token matches
the art on the corresponding Deployment card.


## VILLAINS

All figures corresponding to unique Imperial ( or ) Deployment cards are villains. Villains follow all
general rules for allies, in addition to the following:
- Once gained as a reward, villains can be brought into a mission as an open group (p.49). (Also see
“Deployment” p.25)

## REBEL ALLIES

Once Rebel players gain an ally as a reward, they can bring that ally to any mission following these rules:
- Immediately after deploying hero figures to the map during setup, Rebel players can choose to deploy up to
one ally. They place all figures corresponding to the ally's Deployment card as close to the Rebel entrance
token as possible.
- The Imperial player then gains threat equal to the deployment cost of the Ally and may immediately
resolve an optional deployment. When using an ally in a mission, give the ally's Deployment card to one
Rebel player. When it is their opportunity to resolve an activation, Rebel players can choose to activate an
ally, collectively controlling it. After activating an ally, exhaust its Deployment card, and then the Imperial
player performs an activation. Rebel allies are often rewarded from green Side Mission cards.
During the Tyrants of Lothal mini campaign, Rebel players follow a different procedure when choosing to
deploy an ally in a mission.
- During step 7 of "Campaign Mission Setup" p.44, after the Rebel players choose and deploy an ally, the
Imperial player no longer gains threat equal to the Deployment cost listed on the Ally card. Instead, the
Imperial player gains threat equal to half that cost (rounded up) and may resolve an optional
deployment. Then, the Imperial player places strain tokens equal to half of the ally's Deployment cost
(rounded down) in their play area.
- During step 1 of the Status Phase, after gaining threat equal to the threat level, the Imperial player
discards 1 strain token from their play area and increases threat by 2. The Imperial player does this each
round until there are no strain tokens in their play area.
- If the ally is defeated, the Imperial player discards any remaining strain tokens in their play area. The
Imperial player does not receive threat for tokens discarded this way.
- During the Tyrants of Lothal campaign, the Rebel players will be prompted to bring a Spectre Ally.
Spectre Allies are those allies with "Spectre" or “Chopper” in their subname, such as C1-10P
(CHOPPER), Kanan Jarrus (SPECTRE-1), and Sabine Wren (SPECTRE-5). (“Spectre Allies” p.56)
- Rebel allies are not heroes. During their activation, they cannot interact with crates or rest. Rebel allies can
perform only one action containing attacks each activation, and follow all other rules for non-hero figures.
- The term "Rebel figures" includes all heroes as well as Rebel allies.
- If an ally has both a regular and elite Deployment card, only the regular card can be used as an ally. If an
ally is rewarded to the heroes and the heroes have already earned that ally, they can use either the elite or
regular Deployment card.
- Some missions give heroes control of a specific ally for that mission. These figures follow all normal rules
for allies but have special deployment rules and do not give the Imperial player additional threat or an
optional deployment. These figures do not restrict heroes from choosing to deploy another ally to the
mission.
If the rebel players gain an ally that has the  (Imperial) or  (Mercenary) affiliation, that ally loses that
affiliation and is considered a  (Rebel) for as long as it is an ally.

## ARMY BUILDING

To play a skirmish, each player builds an army consisting of Deployment cards and Command cards. Armies
are built without any foreknowledge of the opponent's army or the skirmish mission they will be playing.

## CHOOSING DEPLOYMENT CARDS

The Deployment cards (including SKIRMISH UPGRADES) in a player's army must obey the following restrictions:
- Deployment Cost: The total Deployment cost of the army's cards must be 40 or fewer deployment points.
- Affiliation Restriction: All deployment cards in an army must contain the same affiliation icon (p.6).
- Name Restriction: Each army is limited to a number of Deployment cards with the same name:
- Maximum of 1 of each unique Deployment card. (See “Unique” p.62)
- Maximum of 2 of each elite (red) Deployment card. (See “Elite Figure” p.28)
- Maximum of 4 of each regular (gray) Deployment card.
- Skirmish Upgrade Cards: Some Deployment cards have the SKIRMISH UPGRADE trait. These cards provide
special abilities, but unlike normal Deployment cards, they do not have corresponding figures. Rules and
abilities on cards that reference Deployment cards do not affect, do not include, and cannot manipulate
Skirmish Upgrade cards unless the rule or ability states otherwise.
For example, a player cannot use the card "Temporary Alliance" to add Skirmish Upgrade cards from other
factions to their army. Or, as another example, when using "Take Initiative," players cannot choose to
exhaust one of their Skirmish Upgrade cards.

## COMMAND CARD DECK

The Command cards in a player's army determine the tricks and surprises that the player will be able to spring
throughout the course of the skirmish (see "Command cards" p.20).
- Deck Size: Each player's Command card deck must include exactly 15 Command cards.
- Command Cost: The total cost of a player's Command cards must be 15 or fewer points.
- Duplicate Restriction: Each Command card has a number of card limit icons displayed to the right of the
card's cost. The number of icons tells how many copies of that card a player can have in their deck. Most
Command cards have only one icon, restricting the card to one copy per each Command deck.

## ATTACHMENT

Some Imperial Class cards list the word "Attachment" above their abilities. These cards can be attached to
Deployment cards as follows:
- When the Imperial player deploys figures to the map, the player may take one or more "Attachment" cards
that are not already attached to groups and place them on the figures' corresponding Deployment card. The
abilities on the cards apply to all figures in the group.
- When the last figure in a group is defeated, return any cards attached to the Deployment card to the
Imperial player's play area. They may be attached again when deploying figures in the future, following the
rules above.
- Many attachments require the group to have a specific trait, such as "TROOPER." Attachments with these
restrictions cannot be played on a group that does not have the trait.

## ATTACKS

Figures perform attacks to attempt to defeat hostile figures. Each attack uses an attack type (Melee:  or
Ranged: ), attack dice, and  (surge) abilities. For a hero, this information is found on their weapon Item
card. For any other figure, this information is found on its Deployment card.
- Some abilities allow a figure to perform an attack with a different attack type and attack pool than their
normal attack.
- When a hero performs an attack using an attack pool unrelated to their weapons (such as the melee
attack from "Close and Personal" on Biv Bodhrik's Hero Sheet), the hero cannot use any abilities from
their weapons during that attack.
- When a figure corresponding to a Deployment card performs an attack using an alternate attack pool
(such as the melee attack from "Close and Personal" on Biv Bodhrik's Deployment card in Skirmish),
they may still trigger their surge abilities, unless the ability triggering the attack states otherwise.
- Verena Talos's "Close Quarters" ability allows her to perform attacks using an opponent's attack type
and attack pool.
- When using this ability, Verena does not gain access to surge abilities on the targeted figure's
Deployment card, nor does she gain access to that figure's abilities (such as the Probe Droid's
"Targeting Computer" ability).
- When "Close Quarters" is used in relation to a figure without a specific dice pool, such as a figure
with "Arsenal" or "Epic Arsenal," the dice pool is determined by that figure's controlling player by the
same method as if the figure were attacking. For example, if this occurred in relation to a figure with
"Arsenal," the player controlling the targeted figure determines which two dice Verena will use
during "Close Quarters."
- A figure must end its movement (not sharing a space with another non-companion figure) to perform an
attack. (See “Movement”, page 47.)
- During an attack, if the attacker's line of sight to the target space changes or if the defender moves, the
attacker must then re-declare a target space. If none of the defender's spaces are eligible, the attack misses,
there is no target space, and abilities that refer to a target space have no effect. If the target of a  attack
ends its movement such that it is no longer adjacent to the attacker (or within 2 spaces and in line of sight if
the attack has Reach), the attack misses.
- Players cannot target friendly figures with attacks.


## STEPS OF AN ATTACK

When a figure performs an attack, it resolves the steps listed below. For each step, abilities with the same
trigger are resolved in the timing conflict resolution order (“Conflicts”, page 22).
1. Declare Target: Based upon its attack type ( or ), the figure performing the attack (referred to as the
attacker) declares one eligible target for the attack (referred to as the target).
- For a melee attack (), an eligible target is any hostile figure (or an object which can be attacked) in the
same space or adjacent to the attacker (or within 2 spaces and in line of sight if the attack has Reach).
- For a ranged attack (), an eligible target is any hostile figure (or an object which can be attacked)
within line of sight (p.40) of the attacker.
- If the attacker or target have abilities with the timing “before declaring an attack” or “before declaring a
target”, they are performed immediately before step 1.
- During a campaign, when a hero declares target they must also declare one of their weapons to use for
this attack.
- Declaring an attack is the same timing instance as declaring target.
- Abilities or mission rules which allow a figure to perform an attack may further restrict which targets are
eligible.
2. Roll Dice: The attacker rolls their attack dice at the same time as the defender rolls defense dice (listed
under "Defense" on the target figure's Hero sheet or Deployment card).
- If any abilities modify the attack or defense dice pools, they are resolved before rolling.
3. Rerolls: If players have any effects that reroll dice, they are resolved now.
- When dice are rerolled, their old results are ignored and new results are used instead.
- Each die may be rerolled only once per attack regardless of who is rerolling the die.
4. Apply Modifiers: If players have any effects that add or remove symbols or Accuracy, they are applied at
this time. At the end of this step each  (evade) result cancels one  (surge) result. Any  abilities
that provide modifiers are not resolved until step 5.
- Conditions are considered mission rules, so they perform their modifications to the results first. Both
Hidden and Weakened affect the attack/defense results. (See also “Negative Symbols” p. 48.)
5. Spend Surges: If there are any  results remaining, the attacker may spend them to trigger  abilities.
- Each  ability can be used only once per attack.
6. Check Accuracy: If performing a ranged attack () the total Accuracy value must be equal to or greater
than the number of spaces the target is away from the attacker. (See “Accuracy” p.4 and "Counting
Spaces" p.23). If the total Accuracy value is less than this number, the attack misses.
- Note that line of sight and the distance between the attacker and target are determined separately. For
example for large figures they might use different spaces for their determination.
7. Calculate Damage: If the attack misses due to insufficient accuracy or a dodge, the target suffers no .
Otherwise, the value of Pierce allows to ignore a number of (block) results. The remaining number of
 (block) results is subtracted from the total number of  (damage) results, and then the target suffers all
remaining .
8. “After attack resolves” abilities are resolved next, including Blast 15, Cleave 19, and Condition
keywords 22.
- Any effects that trigger after an attack resolves use "during an attack" timing conflict resolution order.
"After performing" and "after resolving" an attack refer to the same timing instance.
- During an Attack action, all "after resolving an attack" abilities must resolve before any "after resolving
an action" abilities can be triggered.


## SPECIAL SITUATIONS REGARDING ATTACKS

- Unlike heroes, a figure that has a Deployment card can use only one of its actions to attack per activation.
This includes using special actions that involve performing one or more attacks (such as the Nexu's
"Pounce" or Darth Vader's "Brutality").
- If an ability allows a figure to perform an attack outside of its activation, this attack does not count toward
the limit of one attack per activation.
- A figure cannot target an empty space with an attack.
- A figure cannot target a friendly figure with an attack. Note that friendly figures may suffer  from some
abilities, such as Blast.
- Dice rolled by the attacker are referred to as the attack pool, while all dice rolled by the defender are
referred to as the defense pool.
- Red, blue, yellow, and green dice are referred to as attack dice. Black and white dice are referred to as
defense dice. (See also “Dice Types” p.27)
- The keyword abilities Blast and Cleave, and any Condition keyword require the target of the attack to
suffer one or more  to be be performed after the attack resolves.
- Any ability that is resolved "while attacking" or "while defending" can be used at any point during the
attack with the following exceptions:
- An ability that modifies a dice pool can only be used immediately before step 2 of the attack.
- An ability that allows a player to reroll dice can only be used during step 3 of the attack.
- An ability that allows a player to modify die results can only be used during step 4 of the attack.
- If an ability has an explicit timing, for example “when declaring attack”, it is performed fully with that
explicit timing.
- Some abilities allow players to perform an attack with a hostile figure. To resolve such an attack, the player
resolving the ability controls the hostile figure for the duration of that attack.
- The player resolving the ability chooses the target of the attack. All non-neutral figures are considered
hostile and no figures are considered friendly when performing this attack. The figure cannot target
itself.
- During a campaign, while a Rebel player is attacking with an Imperial figure or the Imperial player is
attacking with a Rebel figure, that figure is considered to be both Rebel and Imperial by mission rules.
- The player resolving the ability rolls the attack dice and can use any of the figure's abilities as if the
figure were their own.
- A figure that uses such an ability does not count as having performed an attack.
- When a player performs an attack with a hostile figure, that player may spend one of that figure's power
tokens.
- An ability that does not involve an attack but causes a figure to suffer damage (such as Darth Vader's
"Force Choke") is not considered to be an attack.
- During a campaign, a hero performing an attack may spend 1 to recover 1. Limit once per attack.

## ATTACKING OBJECTS

Mission rules can allow a figure to attack objects, such as doors or tokens. (See “Objects”, page 49.)
- Mission rules specify how much Health the object has. Any  it suffers is placed on or adjacent to the
object. If an object suffers  equal to or greater than its Health, it is destroyed and removed from the map.
If the object is a door, it is considered to have opened.
- Many abilities that modify attacks can also affect objects that can be attacked, but some cannot. An ability
that refers to a target can be used when attacking an object, but an ability that refers to a figure cannot. If
the ability can modify any attack and does not specify target or figure, it can be used when attacking an
object.
- Abilities that apply damage to objects only affect objects that can be attacked.
- Conditions cannot be applied to objects, and objects cannot suffer . Objects cannot be pushed.
- Mission rules specify if the object rolls defense dice or has any inherent  while being attacked. If it does
not list a die color, it does not roll any dice.
- If a figure is in the same space as the object, the figure and object are targeted for attacks independently.
Neither the figure nor the object block line of sight to the other.
- The Blast and Cleave keywords can affect objects that can be attacked. If a figure is in the same space as
the token, the figure and token are considered adjacent for the purposes of Blast and Cleave.
- For abilities that refer to adjacency, the spaces that share an edge with a door are the only spaces that are
considered to be adjacent to that door (and the door adjacent to those spaces). When declaring a  (melee)
attack targeting a door, the attacker must be in one of those spaces. If the attacker has Reach, the attacker
must be in or adjacent to one of those spaces.
- When attacking a door using a  (ranged) attack or using an ability that refers to line of sight to or distance
to or distance from a door (counting spaces), the door is considered to be occupying each empty space with
which it shares an edge.
(If the ranged attacker is adjacent to a door, the attack can target the door in the figure's own space even if
the spaces on this side of the door are occupied. Anything else would be silly.)

## ATTRIBUTES

During a campaign, each hero has varying expertise in the following three attributes:
- Strength (): Strength is a measure of a figure's physical strength and toughness.
 tests are often used to overcome physical obstacles or resist a physical threat.
- Insight (): Insight is a measure of a figure's mental fortitude and discipline.
 tests are often related to the use of the Force or general perception and awareness.
- Tech (): Tech is a measure of a figure's manual dexterity and technical ability.
 tests are often related to slicing terminals and repairing objects.
- Mission effects often test these attributes, requiring the hero to roll specific dice to determine if a positive
or negative effect is resolved.
Related Topics: Attribute Tests 14


## ATTRIBUTE TESTS

During a campaign, some effects instruct figures to perform attribute tests. This is listed by placing the
attribute's icon in parentheses. For example, a mission rule may say, "A hero can interact with a terminal ()."
This means that the hero can interact with a terminal to test their  attribute.
To perform a test, the player rolls the dice listed on their Hero sheet directly below that attribute icon. If the
player rolls one or more  results, the player passes the test. If the player does not roll any  results, the
player fails the test.
- Each game effect that requires an attribute test specifies the outcome of passing or failing the test. If only
one outcome of the test is specified, the other outcome has no effect.
- Sometimes an interact requires a figure to pass an attribute test to resolve an effect. The effect listed after
the word "to" is resolved only if the figure passes the test.
- Many attribute tests required by mission rules require the figure performing the test to interact with an
object (such as a mission token, terminal, or door). These are referred to as attribute tests on objects.
- Each  rolled is a success. If an attribute test lists a number directly before the icon such as “(3 )”,
multiple successes are needed in order to pass the test. If the figure does not roll the required number of
successes, the figure fails the test but places one strain token near the object for each success. The next time
any figure attempts this test for that object, it discards these strain tokens and applies +1 to their test
results for each token discarded. Successes are only saved when the attribute test is associated with an
object.
- If an attribute test gives the option of multiple attributes, such as "( or )," the figure chooses one of the
attributes to test. If this test also requires multiple successes, the number is written before the first icon. For
example, (2  or ) requires two successes, from any combination of  and  attribute tests.
- Only heroes roll dice for attribute tests. If an elite figure is required to perform an attribute test, it
automatically receives 1 success. If a regular figure is required to perform a test, it automatically fails.
- Some missions allow any Rebel figure to perform attribute tests on objects, instead of only heroes. If this
occurs, allies can interact to perform those tests in the same way a hero would. Elite figures automatically
receive 1 success when they perform attribute tests. Regular figures automatically fail tests.
- Some abilities give a figure the option of whether or not to perform an attribute test. If that figure chooses
not to perform the test, it counts as not having succeeded that test.

## BANES AND BOONS

Return to Hoth campaign only – While a Threat Mission (p.60) is an active mission, the ability on it grants the
respective Bane Reward card to the Imperial player.
In addition to their effects as Reward cards, Banes and Boons put into play and earned through the various
threat missions have additional effects throughout the campaign. Some story mission events will vary in favor
of the Rebels or the Imperial player based on the number of Bane or Boon cards currently in play.
Related Topics: Campaign Setup 18, Threat Missions 60


## BLAST

The Blast keyword appears on some cards. If the target of an attack that has the Blast keyword suffers one or
more  (damage), each figure and object other than the target on or adjacent to the target space suffers 
equal to the Blast value. For example, "Blast 1" causes each other figure and object than the target on or
adjacent to the target space to suffer 1.
- Blast is applied after the attack resolves. Blast does not affect the target of the attack.
- The  from Blast affects both hostile and friendly figures. (When playing a Legends of the Alliance
campaign, friendly figures are not affected by Blast.)
- Blast only affects other figures and objects on or adjacent to the target space and does not affect the target
of the attack.
- The  suffered by Blast is not prevented by .
- If an attack inflicts a condition, such as Stunned or Bleeding, the condition is applied only to the target of
the attack and not to figures affected by Blast.
Related Topics: Attacks 10, Attacking Objects 13, Conditions 22, Keywords 39,
Large Figures 39, Target 59

## BLEEDING

Bleeding is a HARMFUL condition. A figure with Bleeding can use the  specified on the Bleeding
condition card to discard Bleeding.
If a figure has Bleeding after it has resolved an action, the figure suffers 1 .
Bleeding is not voluntarily suffering strain.
Related Topics: Conditions 22, Strain 58

## BLOCKING TERRAIN

Blocking terrain is represented by a solid red line surrounding a space of the map. Figures cannot enter, be
pushed into, count spaces through, or trace line of sight through a space of blocking terrain.
- Sometimes blocking terrain is only on one edge of a space. Figures cannot move through, be pushed
through, or be placed on (if a Large figure) a blocking edge unless they have a special ability that allows
this, such as Massive or Mobile.
- If a figure with Massive or Mobile occupies a space containing blocking terrain, line of sight can be traced
to that figure, spaces can be counted to that figure, and adjacency can be determined for that figure.
- To draw line of sight to a figure or object occupying blocking terrain, you draw line of sight to its space
(or a chosen space if the figure or object occupies more than one space). You can draw line of sight into
the space, but not through it.
- When drawing line of sight from a figure or object occupying blocking terrain, you can draw line of
sight out of its space (the space chosen if the figure or object occupies more than one space).
- If a figure or object without Mobile or Massive occupies a space containing blocking terrain, apply the
rules for Mobile to that figure or object.
- While a figure occupies a space bordered on all four edges by walls or spaces that contain blocking terrain
(such as in  01B ”the Spire”):
- Those spaces of blocking terrain do not block counting spaces to or from that figure's space.
- Those spaces of blocking terrain do not block line of sight to or from that figure's space.
- Melee attacks can be declared by or targeting that figure, ignoring those spaces of blocking terrain.
- Those spaces of blocking terrain still block movement.

## BOUNTY TOKENS

The Hutt Mercenaries Imperial class uses Bounty tokens to place prices on the heroes' heads,
inspiring Imperial figures, especially mercenaries, to take them down. These tokens have no
inherent function and only interact with abilities found on Hutt Mercenaries Imperial Class cards.
During campaign setup, when Hutt Mercenaries is chosen as the Imperial class, the Imperial player places the
four Bounty tokens near their play area. At the start of the campaign, each hero will claim 1 Bounty token. As
the campaign progresses, heroes will claim and discard these tokens as described on the "Wanted: Dead"
Imperial Class card.
Unlike other tokens, heroes do not discard Bounty tokens at the end of a mission during "Post-Mission
Cleanup."
The total number of Bounty tokens that can be used is equal to the number of heroes in the campaign.

## BUILDING A SIDE MISSION DECK

During campaign setup, players separate the Side Mission cards into piles by type (color). Shuffle the following
cards together to create the Side Mission deck:
- One red Side Mission card corresponding to each hero in the campaign.
- Four (two if playing a Return to Hoth campaign) green Side Mission cards chosen by the rebel players. The
rebel players cannot choose more than one of these cards that rewards the same ally, regardless of the ally's
subtitle, such as "Hero of the Rebellion."
They may choose more than one mission that rewards “Any 1 Spectre ally.” (See “Spectre Allies” p.56)
- Four (two if playing a Return to Hoth campaign) random gray Side Mission cards. These are dealt
facedown and are not shown to any players.
Related Topics: Campaign Setup 18


## CAMPAIGN

A campaign is a series of linked missions with a progressing narrative. Throughout the course of the campaign,
players resolve a variety of missions and acquire Agenda, Item, Reward, and Class cards.
- Story missions are specific to their own campaigns. A story mission from one campaign cannot be played in
another.
- Most side missions can be played in any full-length campaign.
- The missions included in Twin Shadows, The Bespin Gambit, and Tyrants of Lothal expansions can be
played in succession to form a narrative mini campaign (p.42).
- Players record information about the campaign in the campaign log (p.17).
- During the Jabba's Realm campaign, the Imperial player cannot earn Jabba the Hutt as a villain.
- During the Tyrants of Lothal campaign, the Imperial player cannot earn Hondo Ohnaka or Thrawn as a
villain.

## CAMPAIGN LOG

After performing the campaign setup
(p.18), players use the corresponding
campaign log to track and record
information relevant to the progression
of the campaign. The campaign log can
be found at the back of the respective
campaign book and printable copies can
also be found online at:
www.FantasyFlightGames.com under
Player Resources.
The campaign log sheet consists of four
sections:
- The Empire and Rebel sections
provide space to record the earned
XP, credits, and influence, as well
as purchased class and agenda cards, and earned rewards including earned allies and villains.
- The Campaign Log area itself lists mission slots, and for each mission slot the three stages in order:
- Mission Stage (p.46) with the
type of mission to play and the
threat level to use,
- Rebel Upgrade Stage (p.52),
- Imperial Upgrade Stage (p.35).
The introductory mission is usually already filled in, in this case “Aftermath” is the introductory mission of
the core campaign.
- Below the Campaign Log area there is room to write down any forced missions (see p.31) which may
become active during the campaign. Currently there are only three forced missions – one from mission
results in the core campaign (“Captured”), and two from agenda cards (“Impounded” and “Wanted”).

## CAMPAIGN SETUP

There are many campaigns available through the core box and each boxed expansion. The core campaign and
campaigns from big-box expansions are full-length campaigns (11 missions, except Heart of the Empire is 8
missions). The small-box expansions contain mini campaigns (4 to 7 missions, see “Mini Campaigns” p.42).
Once the players have chosen a specific campaign to play, perform the following steps.
1. Choose Player Roles: Players choose one player to take on the role of the Imperial player. All other
players are Rebel players. Players retain these roles for the entirety of the campaign.
2. Choose Heroes: Each Rebel player chooses one Hero sheet and places that hero's Class deck and figure in
their play area. Then, each Rebel player retrieves any Item cards that do not have a cost from their Class
deck and places them faceup in that their play area.
- The rebel players can choose to control additional heroes to play a 4-hero campaign.
- If playing a 2-hero game, each hero claims a "Legendary" Reward card. If playing a 3-hero game, each
hero claims a "Heroic" Reward card. These rewards grant extra Health and extra activation tokens.
3. Choose Imperial Class: Then the Imperial player chooses an Imperial Class deck and places any basic
cards without an experience (XP) cost faceup in the Imperial player's play area.
- If the Imperial player's chosen Imperial class has multiple basic cards (without an XP cost), each of
those cards are placed faceup in their play area.
4. Build Agenda Deck: The Imperial player builds their deck of Agenda cards (see "Building the Agenda
Deck" on page 7). If playing a minicampaign, return all cards in their Agenda deck that are played as side
or forced missions to the game box.
5. If playing a full campaign, Build Side Mission Deck: Build the Side Mission deck (see "Building the Side
Mission Deck" on page 16).
- If playing a Return to Hoth campaign, Prepare Threat Missions: The Imperial player shuffles the four
Threat Mission cards (see "Threat Missions" p.60) and places them in a deck near the Side Mission
deck.
If playing a minicampaign, Upgrade Heroes and Imperial Player:
- Upgrade Heroes: If playing Twin Shadows or The Bespin Gambit each hero receives 3 XP and heroes
collectively receive 400 credits per hero. If playing Tyrants of Lothal each hero receives 2 XP and
heroes collectively receive 300 credits per hero. Then, heroes resolve a Rebel Upgrade Stage (p.52).
When purchasing Item cards during this Rebel Upgrade Stage, Rebel players draw cards from the Tier 1
Item deck.
- Upgrade Imperial Player: If playing Twin Shadows or The Bespin Gambit the Imperial player receives
3 XP. If playing Tyrants of Lothal the Imperial player receives 2 XP. Then, the player performs an
Imperial Upgrade Stage (p.35), but skips purchasing Agenda cards (there is no influence to spend).
6. Set Up Introductory Mission: Players are then ready to set up and play the Introductory mission for the
campaign. The name of the mission is specified in the campaign log (p.17) of the chosen campaign.
- The Introductory mission for the core campaign is “Aftermath”, for Return to Hoth “The Battle of
Hoth”, for Jabba's Realm “Trespass”, for Heart of the Empire “Dark Recon”.
- For Twin Shadows, the Introductory mission is "Hunted Down", for The Bespin Gambit "Reclamation",
for Tyrants of Lothal “Call to Action”.

## JABBA THE HUTT

During the Jabba's Realm campaign, the Imperial player cannot earn Jabba the Hutt as a villain.

## HONDO OHNAKA & THRAWN

During the Tyrants of Lothal campaign, the Imperial player cannot earn Hondo Ohnaka or Thrawn as a villain.

## CLAIM

When a player claims a token or component, the player places it in their play area (p.50). The effect of claiming
a token is explained in the mission's rules.
- At the end of a mission, all claimed tokens are returned to the game box.
- Claim is different than retrieve.
Related Topics: Crate Tokens 23, Interact 37, Play Area 50, Retrieving Tokens 54

## CLASS CARDS

During a campaign, each player has a deck of Class cards.
- At the start of the campaign, the Imperial player chooses any Imperial Class deck and each Rebel player
receives the Class deck corresponding to their hero.
- At the start of the campaign, each player gains any Class cards in their deck that do not have a cost (shown
in the lower left corner of the card).
- Players can purchase additional Class cards by spending experience points during the Rebel or Imperial
Upgrade Stages.
- Class cards that have been purchased remain faceup in a player's play area. They have ongoing effects as
listed on the cards. Class cards cannot be traded between heroes.
- Some Class card abilities have costs. If this cost cannot be paid, the text immediately following this cost
cannot be resolved. Ability costs are explained under "Abilities" on page 3.
- Some Class cards have multiple abilities separated by a horizontal line. These abilities can be used
independently and have separate costs and requirements in order to use them.
- Some heroes have a Class deck that includes Item cards with an XP cost. These cards can be purchased
with XP like any other Class card and are used like other items of the same type. If a player wishes to sell
any of these items after purchasing them, the player may do so for 50 credits like any other Item card
without a listed credit cost.

## CLEAVE

The Cleave keyword appears on some cards. If an attack has the Cleave keyword and the target of this attack
suffers one or more  (damage), the attacker may choose a different hostile figure or object that they could
target for this attack. The chosen figure or object suffers the amount of  listed. For example, "Cleave 1"
causes the chosen figure or object to suffer 1.
- Cleave is applied after the attack resolves.
- The chosen figure or object must be an eligible target. For example, for a  (melee) attack (without Reach),
the chosen figure must be adjacent to the attacker.
- The  suffered from Cleave is not prevented by .
- If an attack has multiple Cleave abilities, they are resolved one at a time in the order of the attacker's
choice. The target is independently chosen for each Cleave using the normal rules.
- If an attack inflicts a condition, such as Stunned or Bleeding, this condition is applied only to the target of
the attack and not to the figures or objects affected by Cleave.
- When a figure uses the Cleave keyword during a  attack, the hostile figure chosen to suffer the  from
Cleave must be within line of sight of the attacker and within a number of spaces of the attacker equal to or
less than the Accuracy result of the attack.
Related Topics: Attacks 10, Attacking Objects 13, Conditions 22, Keywords 39


## COMMAND CARDS

During a skirmish, players play Command cards to resolve a wide range of powerful abilities.
- During setup, each player draws three Command cards into their hand. Command cards in a player's hand
are kept secret from their opponent.
- Each player draws one Command card each Status Phase, plus one additional Command card for each
terminal token the player controls (Control p.23).
- After the effect of a Command card has resolved, it is placed faceup in the player's discard pile.
- If there are no cards remaining in a player's Command deck, the player cannot draw Command cards.
- A player cannot play multiple copies of the same Command card at the same time (on the same trigger
condition or during the same timing instance). For example, if a card provides "+2 Accuracy," the player
cannot play two copies of that card to gain +4 Accuracy for the same attack.
- Many Command cards have a restriction box listed above the ability. When playing a Command card that
lists a trait, figure name, and/or affiliation icon, it must be played on a single friendly figure that matches
all of the restrictions listed.
If the card has the  (special action) icon, that figure must spend one action to resolve the ability.
If the card has two special action icons ( ), that figure must spend two actions to resolve the ability.
- Each player has their own deck of 15 Command cards. The player chooses which cards to place in this deck
when building their army. The following limits must be obeyed:
- The total cost of cards in the command card deck must be 15 or less.
- Each Command card has a number of restriction icons next to its cost. This is the maximum number of
copies of that card a player can have in their deck.

Terminal Tokens 59


## COMPANIONS

A companion is a support figure that is put into play through various game effects and is often associated with a
hero or a group. The companion shares that hero or group's affiliation and activates before or after the
corresponding activation.
When a companion is put into play, place its Companion card faceup in the ready position near its associated
Deployment card or Hero sheet. Then, place its token on the map as indicated by the effect putting it into play.
A companion follows all normal rules for figures with the following exceptions:
- A companion does not block line of sight, and a hostile figure does not spend one additional movement
point to enter a space containing a companion.
- A companion can end its movement in a space containing another figure, and another figure can end its
movement in a space containing a companion.
- A companion is adjacent to each figure and object in its space, and each of those figures and objects are
adjacent to the companion.
- A companion cannot interact.
- A companion has a figure cost of 0 (see "Figure Cost", page 30).
- If a companion performs an attribute test, it automatically fails.
- When a group that is associated with a companion leaves play, the companion remains in play but can no
longer activate unless a game effect allows that companion to activate as part of a different group.
- During a campaign, only one companion of each type can be in play at a time. During a skirmish, each
player may have only one companion of each type in play.
- When a companion is put into play under a player's control, if that companion was already in play under
that player's control, it is removed from the map first.
- During a skirmish, abilities that specifically affect a companion can affect only your companion.
- A companion is not a member of its associated group.

## COMPONENT LIMITATIONS

If players are required to use more components than found in the game, follow these rules:
- Tokens are not limited. If players run out of a token type, they should use a suitable replacement.
- If players are required to roll more dice than those included in the game, they should record the current
result, reroll the needed dice, and combine the results. This does not count as a reroll.
- If players run out of a card type, additional cards of that type cannot be drawn or used.
- In a campaign, players are limited to the number of figures included in the game. For example, the Imperial
player is limited to six regular and three elite Stormtrooper figures, even if the player owns multiple copies
of the game, or the Stormtrooper villain pack.
- Each expansion specifies how they are integrated. Boxed expansions generally limit you to the figures and
cards found in each expansion. The figure expansion packs (ally and villain packs) limit you to the number
of deployment cards found in each expansion. This means two packs worth of figures for the non-unique
imperial and mercenary expansions that have both regular and elite deployment cards for the group. All
unique groups and all rebel allies are naturally limited to one group due to the game mechanisms.
- In a skirmish, a player can have a maximum of one of each unique Deployment card in their army, two of
each elite Deployment card, and four of each regular Deployment card.
Related Topics: Imperial Figures 35, Elite Figure 28, Unique 62


## CONDITIONS

Conditions are ongoing effects that are applied to figures. Each condition has an ability that applies to the
figure as long as it has that condition.
- When a hero gains a condition, place the corresponding Condition card next to that hero. As long as it has
that Condition card, it must follow all rules on the card.
- When any other figure gains a condition, place a condition token next to that figure. As long as it has that
token, it must follow all rules on the corresponding Condition card. The condition token stays with the
figure if it moves or is placed in another space.
- Each Condition card lists when the condition is discarded. When this situation occurs, discard the card or
token; the figure no longer follows the rules listed on the Condition card.
- Conditions have the BENEFICIAL or HARMFUL trait. This trait has no inherent effect but may be referred to by
abilities. Focused, Hidden are BENEFICIAL, Bleeding, Stunned, Weakened are HARMFUL conditions.
- A figure cannot be affected by multiple instances of the same condition. For example, if a figure that is
already Stunned would become Stunned again for any reason, nothing happens.
- Condition keywords (Focus, Hide, Bleed, Stun, Weaken) are sometimes gained for attacks. When an attack
has a condition keyword, the corresponding condition is applied using the following rules:
- The target of the attack must suffer one or more  in step 7 of the attack for the corresponding
condition to be applied. The corresponding condition is applied after the attack resolves.
- BENEFICIAL conditions are applied to the attacker. HARMFUL conditions are applied to the target.
- Objects cannot gain conditions.

## CONFLICTS

Numerous abilities, mission rules, and other game effects can be triggered at the same time.
- While attacking, mission rules and effects from conditions are resolved with priority, followed by effects
from the attacker (including figures friendly to him), then effects from the defender (including figures
friendly to him).
- While attacking during a Four-Player Team Battle skirmish (p.32), mission rules are resolved with priority,
followed by effects from the attacker and the attacker's figures, then effects from the defender and their
figures. Then, the attacker's teammate may resolve effects, followed by the defender's teammate.
- Effects from multiple figures under the control of a single player are resolved in the order of that player's
choice.
- The decision for a player to resolve an optional ability coincides with the order of resolution. After a player
has declined to trigger one or more abilities, the player does not have the opportunity to trigger that ability
until the next triggering instance.

## CONFLICTS IN A CAMPAIGN

During a campaign, outside of attacks, mission rules are resolved first, followed by effects from the Imperial
player, then effects from the Rebel players.
- If multiple mission rules would resolve at the same time, the Imperial player decides their order.
- When Rebel players wish to resolve multiple effects at the same time, they collectively decide the order.
- If heroes are required to make a decision as a group and cannot come to a consensus, the Imperial player
chooses a Rebel player to make the final decision.

## CONFLICTS IN A SKIRMISH

During a skirmish, outside of attacks, mission rules are resolved first, followed by effects from the player with
initiative, then effects from each other player, proceeding clockwise around the table.
- If multiple mission rules would resolve at the same time, the player with initiative decides their order.

## CONTROL

Many missions require players to Control tiles, tokens, or deployment zones.
- A player Controls a tile if there is at least one friendly figure in any space of the tile and no hostile figures
in any spaces of the tile. – If both friendly and hostile figures are on the same tile, no one Controls the tile.
- A player Controls a token if there is at least one friendly figure on or adjacent to the token and there are no
hostile figures on or adjacent to the token.
- If both friendly and hostile figures are on or adjacent to the token, no one Controls the token.
- In a Skirmish, a player Controls a deployment zone if there is at least one friendly figure in any space of
that deployment zone and no hostile figures in any space of that deployment zone.

## CONVERT

Some abilities convert one die result into another. When resolving one of these abilities, the old result is
removed from the dice results and the new result is added to the dice results (attack/defense pool).
- Abilities that remove or add accuracy or symbols are resolved during the Apply Modifiers step of an attack,
unless they require spending a  (surge).
- After being converted, the new result may be converted again by other effects.
Related Topics: Attacks 10

## COUNTING SPACES

Many effects require players to measure the distance between figures, objects, and/or spaces. To determine this
number, the player counts how many moved spaces it would take for a small figure to move from one space to
the other. The value for the distance can be 0. Impassable terrain can be moved into and through for this
measurement. This measurement cannot go through walls, doors, or blocking terrain.
- If a figure's ability specifies to choose something within a set number of spaces, players count spaces from
the figure using the ability. Likewise, if an ability specifies to choose an adjacent figure, the figure must be
adjacent to the figure using the ability.
- If a figure or object occupies a space of blocking terrain, the distance between them and another figure or
object or a space is determined by counting spaces to the space the figure or object occupies, ignoring the
terrain for the space you count spaces to (and count spaces from if the other figure or object occupies
blocking terrain). If the distance is 1, the figure or object is adjacent to the other figure, object, or space.
This does not make the spaces they occupy adjacent.
Related Topics: Adjacent 6, Blocking Terrain 15, Blocking Terrain Examples 68,
Doors 27, Terrain 60, Walls 62

## CRATE TOKENS

Many missions place crate tokens on the map.
- Crate tokens do not block line of sight or figure movement. Figures may move through
and end their movement in the same space as a crate token.
- If a crate token is in a space containing terrain, the terrain in the space still takes effect.
For example, a space with blocking terrain that contains a crate token still blocks line of
sight, and figures cannot enter the space.
- During a campaign, crates are objects that heroes can interact (p.37) with to Claim (p.19) the token and
draw a Supply card.
- During a campaign, at the end of each mission, heroes receive 50 credits for each crate token they have in
their play areas.
- The color of crate tokens has no game effect unless specified by the mission.
- A crate token with its colored side down cannot be examined by players. This color is hidden information.

## CREDITS

During a campaign, heroes gain credits as rewards at the end of most missions. During Rebel Upgrade Stages,
heroes can spend credits to purchase Item cards.
- Credits are tracked on the campaign log, and shared by all heroes.
- When heroes gain credits, they add them to the credits on the campaign log and record this total. When
heroes spend credits, they subtract them from the credits on the campaign log and record this total.
- Heroes do not have to spend all of their credits. Unspent credits may be spent during future Rebel Upgrade
Stages.
- At the end of each campaign mission, heroes receive 50 credits for each crate token they have in their play
areas.
Related Topics: Crate Tokens 23, Item Cards 38, Rebel Upgrade Stage 52

## DAMAGE

Many game effects cause figures to suffer  (damage). This is most often suffered from attacks and Blast and
Cleave, but can also be suffered from a variety of abilities.
- When a figure has suffered  equal to or exceeding its Health, it is defeated (p.24).
- When a hero suffers , place an equal number of damage tokens on their Hero sheet.
- When any other figure suffers , place an equal number of damage tokens next to the figure. These
damage tokens move with the figure.
- If a figure suffers  outside of an attack, the  is not prevented by , and the figure does not roll
defense dice.
- Some damage tokens have a "5" printed on them. Each of these tokens represent "5" damage tokens, and
any player can freely exchange one of these tokens for five single damage tokens.
- When a game effect mentions the amount of  a figure "has suffered," it refers to the total value of
damage tokens currently on its Hero sheet or by its figure.
- A figure or object cannot suffer  in excess of its Health. Any  over this amount has no effect.
- If an effect causes a figure to reduce its Health value, and it has suffered an amount of  greater than the
resulting Health value, any  in excess of its Health is discarded and has no effect.

## DEFEATED

When a figure has a number of damage tokens equal to its Health, the figure is defeated.
- When a hero is defeated for the first time during a mission, the hero is wounded and flips the Hero sheet to
the wounded side. If a wounded hero is defeated, the hero withdraws and is removed from the map.
When any other figure is defeated, it is removed from the map along with any of its condition and damage
tokens.
- When being defeated and removed from the map the figure is not voluntarily exiting the spaces it occupied.
- If a figure is defeated during its activation, its activation ends.
- During a campaign, when the last Imperial figure in a non-unique group is defeated, the Deployment card
is returned to the Imperial player's hand and can be optionally deployed later in the mission using normal
deployment rules.

Withdraw 63, Wounded 64


## DEPLETE

When a card is depleted, it is flipped facedown and cannot be used for the remainder of the mission. At the end
of each mission, all depleted cards are flipped faceup.
When a card is depleted, abilities on that card no longer have any effect. For example, if MHD-19 uses the
"deplete" ability on their Reward card "Systems Upgrade", the card's "+2 Health" ability is no longer active,
and MHD-19's Health is immediately reduced by 2.
Related Topics: Abilities 3

## DEPLOYMENT

Deployment is the primary method by which figures are placed on the map during a mission.
When deploying groups, a player places the Deployment card faceup and in the ready position on the table.
Then, the player places all figures from that group in and as close as possible to the location indicated by the
campaign guide or deployment zone.

## CAMPAIGN DEPLOYMENT

The Imperial player deploys figures throughout the course of every mission. The "Deployment and Setup" box
in the mission's rules lists which figures the Imperial player can deploy throughout the mission (see "Mission
Setup" on page 44).
- Deployment location is determined by named tiles or icons, such as deployment points, on the map.
- When the location for a figure's deployment is not specified, it is deployed as close as possible to any
active deployment point shown in the mission's diagram, chosen by the Imperial player. This includes
the space containing the deployment point.
- Green deployment points are active at the start of each mission. Other deployment points are not
active until specified by the mission's rules, even if another rule allows a one-time deployment to any
of those points.
- When the Imperial player resolves an optional deployment, for example during the Status Phase, the
Imperial player can deploy any Deployment cards from their hand. The imperial player must spend 
(threat) equal to the group's deployment cost, and then deploy all figures in that group to any active
deployment point.
- Reserved groups can only be deployed by mission events. Figures deployed as initial or reserved groups
do not cost  to deploy.
- When an initial or reserved group is defeated, except for unique figures, the Deployment card is
returned to the Imperial player's hand and can be later deployed during an optional deployment (such as
the Deploy and Reinforce step of the Status Phase).
- The Imperial player may deploy any number of groups during each optional deployment (p.49), including
the Deploy and Reinforce step of the Status Phase. The Imperial player can also reinforce (p.53) figures
during optional deployments.
- Deployment points on the mission's map diagram are hidden information. The Imperial player must follow
these icons, but cannot show the map to the Rebel players. Mission rules tell the players when deployment
points become active and inactive, but their exact locations are hidden from the Rebel players. However,
the Rebel players can observe where further deployments are placing figures to deduce their locations.

## SKIRMISH DEPLOYMENT

During setup of a skirmish, players place all of their figures within their deployment zone. “Skirmish Mission
Setup” p.45.

## DEPLOYMENT CARDS

All non-hero figures have corresponding Deployment cards. These cards list the group's name, group size,
abilities, Speed, Health, Defense, and attack.
Some Deployment cards can be used in only one style of play in Imperial Assault. A Deployment card marked
with a Campaign Deployment Icon () can be used only in a campaign, while a Deployment card marked with
a Skirmish Deployment Icon () can be used only in a skirmish.
- In a campaign, since  Deployment cards have a different back from  Deployment cards, the Rebel
players will know how many  and  cards are in the Imperial player's hand of deployment cards and in
reserved groups.
- Elite Deployment cards have a red border. All other Deployment cards are regular Deployment cards and
have gray borders.
- Unique cards are identified by a bullet (▪) before the name, for example, "▪ Darth Vader".
- Deployment and Companion cards list a number of traits under the name (such as TROOPER). Traits have no
inherent gameplay effect, but may be referred to by other components and by some rules. For example,
traits are used to restrict playing of Command Cards p.20, and limit modifications you can add on weapon
items p.38.
- In a skirmish, some Deployment cards have the SKIRMISH UPGRADE trait. Rules and abilities that reference
Deployment cards do not affect, do not include, and cannot manipulate Skirmish Upgrade cards unless the
rule or ability states otherwise.
For example, a player cannot use the card "Temporary Alliance" to add Skirmish Upgrade cards from other
factions to their army. As another example, when using "Take Initiative," players cannot choose to exhaust
one of their Skirmish Upgrade cards.

## DEPLOYMENT POINTS

In a campaign, green deployment points are active at the start of each mission. Other deployment points are not
active until specified by the mission's rules, even if another rule allows a one-time deployment to any of those
points.
Related Topics: Deployment 25, Hidden Information 34

## DEVICE TOKENS

The hero Saska Teft uses device tokens to grant both herself and her fellow Rebels powerful
abilities. These tokens have no inherent function and only interact with abilities found on Saska
Teft's Hero sheet and Class cards.
During campaign setup, when Saska Teft is chosen as a hero, place the device tokens in a supply near her play
area. During a mission, Saska's abilities may allow friendly figures to claim and discard these tokens for
beneficial effects. Discarded tokens return to Saska's supply.
The number of device tokens that figures can collectively claim is limited by the provided supply of eight
tokens. A figure can individually claim any number of these tokens.
Related Topics: Hero 34


## DICE TYPES

Some abilities refer to a die's type. A die's type is either "attack" or "defense."
- Blue, Red, Green, and Yellow dice are attack dice.
- Black and White dice are defense dice.
Related Topics: Icon Types 35

## DIFFICULT TERRAIN

Difficult terrain is represented by a solid blue line surrounding a group of spaces of the map. If a space contains
a Rubble token, it is considered to contain difficult terrain.
- A figure must spend one additional movement point to enter (p.29) a space containing difficult terrain.
- A figure doesn't need to spend additional movement points to exit (p.30) a space containing difficult terrain.
- Line of sight can be traced through difficult terrain.
- If a space contains a hostile figure and difficult terrain, other figures must spend two additional movement
points to enter the space (one for the figure and one for the terrain).
- When a large figure enters difficult terrain, it spends only one additional movement point, regardless of the
number of spaces of difficult terrain that it occupies.
- Figures that have Massive or Mobile ignore extra movement points costs.
Related Topics: Enter 29, Exit 30, Line of Sight 40, Rubble 54, Terrain 60

## DISTRIBUTE

Some effects allow a player to distribute a number of identical elements amongst various figures. When
distributing tokens, that player gives a number of those elements to each of those figures such that the total
number given out is equal to or less than the amount designated to be distributed. Each figure amongst those to
whom the elements are to be distributed may receive as many as the total number or as few as zero.
Related Topics: Power Tokens 50

## DOORS

Doors are represented by stand-up tokens placed on the map. Each mission specifies where doors are placed.
Doors block line of sight and adjacency.
- Two spaces that share only an edge with a door are not adjacent.
- Figures cannot move, trace line of sight, or count spaces through doors.
- A figure can interact with a door to open it; the player removes the door token from the map.
- If an effect closes a door, place a door token on the map as shown on the mission's map. Figures cannot
voluntarily close doors.
- If a large figure occupies spaces on both sides of a door when it closes, that figure is pushed to the closest
valid space (see "Push" on page 51).
- For abilities that refer to adjacency, the spaces that share an edge with a door are the only spaces that are
considered to be adjacent to that door (and the door is adjacent to those spaces).
- For abilities that refer to distance from or distance to a door (“Counting Spaces” p.23), the door is
considered to be occupying each empty space with which it shares an edge.
- Some missions specify that certain doors are locked. Locked doors cannot be opened except as specified in
the mission rules. A locked door can have Health, and when destroyed it is removed from the map (p.13).
A mission rule can also specify how to unlock a locked door. When a door becomes unlocked, the door
remains closed but can now be opened with an interact following normal rules.
- Some missions allow heroes to place doors. Doors must be placed on exactly two edges. A door cannot
overlap a wall or another door.

Sight 40, Objects 49, Push 51


DURING (YOUR) ACTIVATION
Abilities with a timing of “during an activation” can be performed before or after actions during a figure's
activation, but not during them. Each “during an activation” ability needs to be fully performed before you can
perform another “during an activation” ability.
Spending movement points to move 1 space is a “during your activation” ability. You can perform it repeatedly
in succession without ending movement.
Related Topics: Abilities 3, Actions 4, Movement 47, Movement Points 48.

## ELITE FIGURE

All figures that correspond to elite (red) Deployment cards are elite. Elite figures usually have better abilities
and more Health compared to their regular versions.
- Elite Deployment cards share the same name as regular Deployment cards. When a figure is called out by
name (for example, "Stormtrooper"), this refers to both regular and elite versions of this figure.
- In the campaign guide, elite Deployment cards are always listed in red. If the card name is shown in black,
the guide is referencing the regular version.
- Elite figures are immune to some abilities. For example, an ability may say "Choose a regular figure."
- If an elite figure is required to perform an attribute test, it automatically receives one success.
- Heroes in the campaign are not considered regular or elite.
- A figure with a gray Deployment card is regular and not elite.
Related Topics: Allies 7, Deployment Cards 26, Group 33, Imperial Figures 35

## EMPTY SPACE

Any space that does not contain a figure is empty.
Related Topics: Place 50

## ENDING MOVEMENT

A figure ends movement when it chooses to stop spending movement points (possibly temporarily) to perform
an action or an attack, when running out of movement points, at the end of resolving move X spaces (or push X
spaces), or when being placed in a space by a game effect, for example by deployment.
- A non-companion figure cannot end movement in a space occupied by another non-companion figure
(unless the moving figure has the Massive keyword).
- A figure does not need to end movement to perform a “during your activation” ability that isn't an action or
an attack.
Related Topics: Massive 41, Movement 47, Movement Points 48, Place 50, Push 51

## ENDURANCE

During a campaign, each hero has an Endurance value printed on their hero sheet. This is the maximum number
of  (strain) that the figure can have suffered (the number of  tokens on the hero sheet).
A hero cannot choose to suffer  if the amount of  the hero has suffered would exceed their Endurance. (See
Strain p.58)
Non-hero figures do not have Endurance.
Related Topics: Recover 52, Rest 54, Strain 58, Surges 59


## ENERGY SHIELD

When an ability or effect requires the placement of energy shield, the player takes one of
these tokens from the supply and places it in the space directed by the ability or effect.
A space containing an energy shield blocks line of sight, but does not block movement,
adjacency, or counting spaces. The diagonal intersection of a space containing an energy
shield and either a wall, door, blocking terrain, or another energy shield also blocks line of
sight. Line of sight can be traced to a figure or object occupying a space containing an energy
shield, but Line of sight cannot be traced through a space containing an energy shield. Line of sight can be
drawn out of a space containing an energy shield. (See “Appendix IV – Energy Shield Examples” on page 69.)
A space can contain both rubble and an energy shield.
Related Topics: Line of Sight 40, Rubble 54, Terrain 60

## ENTER

Some effects are triggered when a figure enters a space. Entering a space includes when a figure moves into, is
pushed into, or is placed in the space by an effect (including deployment or reinforcement).
Related Topics: Exit 30, Movement 47, Place 50, Push 51

## ENTRANCE

Entrance refers to the space containing the entrance token. Heroes are deployed to the entrance token at the
start of a mission in a campaign.
Related Topics: Deployment 25, Missions 43

## EPILOGUES

When playing a mini campaign, each mission's "End of Mission" text will direct players to resolve an
additional event. These events are referred to as epilogues and provide additional narrative text as well as
rewards specific to mini campaign progression. The epilogues can be found at the end of the respective mini
campaign rulebook.
Additionally, the epilogue indicates the next active mission the players will resolve. When this happens, players
should record the name and page number of that mission in the next mission entry of the campaign log.
After resolving the epilogue, players progress to the "Post-Mission Cleanup" portion of the Mission Stage.
The Tyrants of Lothal mini campaign can be expanded using side missions found in certain Ally and Villain
packs to create a longer campaign. The Ally and Villain packs involved in the expanded campaign include a
new type of card called Epilogue cards. These cards provide epilogues to the missions contained in the figure
packs. All rules that apply to epilogues also apply to the Epilogue cards. The epilogue cards are not used if the
missions are used as side missions in a full campaign.
Related Topics: Campaign 17, Mini Campaigns 42

## ESCAPING

Certain mission rules can allow a figure to escape. In order to escape, the figure must spend one movement
point while on or adjacent to the space indicated in the mission's rules.
A figure cannot escape while Stunned. When a figure escapes, it is removed from the map. A figure not on the
map cannot be affected by abilities, and cannot perform activations.
Related Topics: Abilities 3, Activation 4, Movement 47, Movement Points 48,
Stunned 58


## EXHAUST

Many game effects and abilities require a player to exhaust a card or (activation) token as a cost. Cards and
tokens that are exhausted must be readied before they can be exhausted again.
- Cards are rotated 90 degrees to mark that they are exhausted.
- Activation tokens are flipped red side up when they are exhausted.
- After a player activates a group, the player exhausts its corresponding Deployment card or activation token
to mark that the figures in that group have already activated during this round.
- After a companion resolves an activation its companion card is exhausted.
- Figures that are not ready cannot be activated.
- A hero with multiple activation tokens is ready (can be activated) if at least one activation token is ready.
- A hero cannot perform a second activation until each hero has performed at least one activation.
- If all Deployment cards or activation tokens belonging to a player are exhausted, the player cannot use
abilities that must be used before, during, or after the player's figure activates.
- Abilities on exhausted cards can be used as long as the abilities do not require the player to exhaust the card
to use the ability.
Related Topics: Abilities 3, Activation 4, Class Cards 19, Deployment Cards 26, Ready 51

## EXIT

Some effects are triggered when a figure exits a space. Exiting a space includes when a figure moves or is
pushed out of a space, or is placed in a different space.
Related Topics: Enter 29, Place 50, Push 51

## EXPANSION ICON

All cards, sheets, and map tiles found in the core game and boxed expansions are marked with the respective
expansion icon to distinguish the components from other expansions.
 Core game  Twin Shadows  Return to Hoth  The Bespin Gambit
 Jabba's Realm  Heart of the Empire  Tyrants of Lothal

## EXPERIENCE POINTS

During a campaign, players gain experience points (XP) as mission rewards. During the Rebel and Imperial
Upgrade Stages, players can spend XP to purchase Class cards.
- Unspent XP is recorded on the campaign log and may be spent during future Upgrade Stages.
Related Topics: Imperial Upgrade Stage 35, Rebel Upgrade Stage 52

## EXTERIOR SPACES

See "Interior Spaces" on page 37.

## FIGURE COST

Each figure in Imperial Assault has a figure cost that may be referenced by abilities and game effects.
- For a single-figure group, the figure cost is equal to the group's deployment cost.
- For a multi-figure group, the figure cost is equal to the figure's reinforcement cost.
- A companion has a figure cost of 0.
- Otherwise, such as the captive from "Imperial Hospitality," (pg. 29, Campaign Guide, core game) the figure
cost is 0.
Related Topics: Companions 21, Deployment Cards 26


## FOCUSED

Focused is a BENEFICIAL condition that provides the figure with an additional green die the next
time the figure performs an attribute test or performs an attack. The condition is discarded after the
attribute test or after attack resolves.
- A figure with this condition automatically gains the extra die when it attacks or performs an attribute test.
The player cannot choose to save the condition for a later attack or test.
- If a figure has the Focus condition keyword for its attack, and the target suffers one or more  (damage),
the attacker gains Focused after the attack resolves.
- Due to timing conflict resolution, an existing Focused is discarded before a new Focused is gained.
- If a figure gains the Focused condition after rolling dice for an attack or test, it cannot use the condition
until the next time it attacks or performs a test.
Related Topics: Attacks 10, Damage 24, Conditions 22

## FORCED MISSIONS

During a campaign, some Agenda cards and mission results can force a certain mission to be played. For
example, if an Agenda card says "Play `Wanted' as a forced mission," players would immediately play this
mission, and then resume the campaign from the next stage on the campaign log.
- Forced missions are recorded on the "Forced Missions" section of the campaign log (p.17). When a mission
is forced and players do not have time to resolve the mission this session, they should record the mission in
the Forced Missions section without checking the box. The next time they resume their campaign, they will
immediately play this mission.
- Forced missions are immediately resolved between campaign stages. After resolving a forced mission,
players should perform the "post-mission cleanup" step of a Mission Stage. Then they resolve the next
available stage on the campaign log.
- If the mission occurs immediately after another mission is resolved, they resolve "post-mission
cleanup", but do not resolve any Rebel or Imperial Upgrade Stages before this mission. The upgrade
stages get resolved after resolving the forced mission.
- The threat level for a forced mission is equal to the threat level of the most recently played mission.
- Because forced missions are never chosen to be played, they do not have corresponding Mission cards.
- If players run out of space in the "Forced Missions" section of the campaign log, something went wrong.
Related Topics: Agenda Cards 6, Mission Events 43

## FORM CARDS

Form cards are a new card type used to represent different shapes, styles, or forms a figure can assume. In
Heart of the Empire, a Clawdite Shapeshifter uses these to represent its transformations. A Form card adds its
text box and abilities box to a Deployment card.
When a Form card is gained, place that Form card, oriented horizontally, below the relevant Deployment card.
All text on the Form card is treated as though it were text on that Deployment card.
A Deployment card can only gain a Form card with a subname corresponding to that Deployment card's name.
Form Cards are unique. If there are multiple Clawdite Shapeshifters in play, only 1 copy of each Clawdite
Shapeshifter Form card can be in play at the same time. During a skirmish, only 1 copy can be in play in each
army instead.

## FOUR-PLAYER SKIRMISHES

The "Hoth Battlefield", “Nal Hutta Borderlands”, and “Temple Gardens” skirmish maps, found on the Skirmish
Map Sheet of Return to Hoth, Jabba's Realm, and Heart of the Empire expansions, allow four players to
compete in a massive Imperial Assault battle. Depending on which mission is played, the players could all
compete against each other in a Free-For-All or in a Team Battle.

## SETUP AND GAMEPLAY CHANGES

During a four-player skirmish players use a skirmish mission deck that includes only Skirmish mission cards
corresponding to four-player skirmish maps.
- Two additional deployment zones are available: yellow and green.
- During the Activation Phase each player activates a group in clockwise order.
- During the ready step of the Skirmish Status Phase (p.57), all players ready all of their exhausted cards and
the player who has the initiative token passes it to the player on their left.

## GAME MODES

There are two different modes of play for four-player skirmishes: Free-For-All and Team Battle.

## FREE-FOR-ALL

When playing a Free-For-All skirmish, all other players are opponents, and all of their figures are hostile
figures.
A Free-For-All skirmish ends immediately when at least one player has gained 40 or more VPs, at which point
the player with the most VPs wins the game. The game will also end when three players have been eliminated,
at which point the remaining player wins the game.

## TEAM BATTLE

During a Team Battle skirmish, the players on your immediate left and right are your opponents and the
remaining player is your teammate. All figures belonging to opponents are hostile, and all figures belonging to
your teammate are friendly.
A Team Battle skirmish ends immediately when one team has collectively gained 60 or more VPs, at which
point the team with the most VPs wins the game. The game will also end when a pair of teammates have both
been eliminated, at which point the remaining team wins the game.

## SPECIAL RULES

In a four-player skirmish, some special rules come into effect.
- When an ability targets your opponent (such as "Shadow Ops"), you must choose one available opponent.
- If a player would claim the initiative token out of turn, such as by playing "Take Initiative," that player
receives the first activation on that turn, but does not claim the initiative token. After the first activation
resolves, play passes to the player with the initiative token and then proceeds normally.
- The player with the initiative token cannot also use effects that would claim the initiative token.
- If multiple players use effects that would claim the initiative token, each of those players gain an
activation that they may use before the player with initiative resolves their first activation. These
activations are resolved in order of initiative.
- A player cannot use more than one effect that would allow him to claim the initiative token in the same
round.
- When the last figure in a group is defeated, if the group has an attachment, the player who defeated that
figure also gains the VPs from the attachment.
- When a figure in a group is defeated, but was not defeated by an opponent, such as when a Probe Droid
becomes defeated after using "Self-Destruct," that figure's player chooses one available opponent to gain
the VPs for that figure (and if last figure in the group, VP from the attachment of that group, if any).
- If all of a player's figures are defeated, that player is eliminated. The player can no longer play cards, and
their Skirmish Upgrade cards no longer have any effect.


- If more than one player includes the Skirmish Upgrade card "Devious Scheme" in their army, then all
copies of "Devious Scheme" have no effect.

## CONFLICTS IN A FOUR-PLAYER SKIRMISH

During a four-player skirmish, mission rules are resolved first, followed by effects from the player with
initiative, and then effects from each other player, proceeding clockwise around the table.
While attacking during a Four-Player Team Battle skirmish (p.32), mission rules are resolved with priority,
followed by effects from the attacker and the attacker's figures, then effects from the defender and their figures.
Then, the attacker's teammate may resolve effects, followed by the defender's teammate.

## FRIENDLY FIGURE

All figures belonging to a player are friendly toward one another.
- A figure is friendly to itself.
- During a campaign, all  (Rebel) figures are friendly toward one another. In addition, all  figures and 
figures are friendly toward one another.
- When playing regular or Four-Player Free-For-All skirmish, all other players are opponents, and all of their
figures are hostile figures.
- During a Four-Player Team Battle skirmish, the players on your immediate left and right are your
opponents and the remaining player is your teammate. All figures belonging to opponents are hostile, and
all figures belonging to teammates are friendly.
- Players cannot target friendly figures with attacks.

## GROUP

All figures that correspond to a single Deployment card or Hero sheet are a group.
- A group can consist of one or more figures.
- Each Deployment card shows a number of bars below its deployment cost. Ttheir is the starting group size.
This number of figures is placed when deploying this group.
- While activating a group of two or more figures, each figure resolves its activation independently. Resolve
both actions for one figure before resolving actions for the next figure.
- When a Deployment card for a group is exhausted, all figures in that group are exhausted and cannot
perform activations.
- If there are multiple versions of the same group in play (regular or elite), each group of these figures needs
to be differentiated.
- To do this, players can place an ID token on the Deployment card and apply matching ID Stickers to the
bases of the corresponding figures.

## HABITAT

Habitat is a keyword found on certain Deployment cards. During a campaign, when the Imperial player is
selecting open groups for a mission, the player can choose a Deployment card with the Habitat keyword only
if there is at least one tile in that mission's map whose tile type (p.61) matches the listed Habitat.
During a skirmish, Habitat has no effect.
Related Topics: Open Groups 49, Tile Types 61

## HEALTH

When a figure has damage tokens equal to its Health, it is defeated. Health is listed on the figure's Deployment
card or Hero sheet.
Related Topics: Damage 24, Defeated 24, Healthy 34


## HEALTHY

During a campaign, a hero is healthy as long as the hero is not wounded. Other figures are healthy until they are
defeated.
Related Topics: Hero 34, Wounded 64

## HERO

During a campaign, each Rebel player controls a hero. The word "Hero" is used to refer to hero figures, the
player controlling the figure, and all of the associated components.
Some heroes use their own tokens and are limited to the number of tokens provided. Saska Teft uses Device
Tokens p.26, Loku Kanaloa uses Recon Tokens p.52, Tress Hacnua uses Style Tokens p.58.
Related Topics: Campaign Setup 18

## HIDDEN

Hidden is a BENEFICIAL condition which applies -2 Accuracy while defending and +1 while
attacking. A figure discards Hidden after resolving an attack.
Related Topics: Accuracy 4, Attacks 10, Conditions 22

## HIDDEN INFORMATION

Some information on cards and tokens is hidden from players, and cannot be examined. The following rules
dictate which information is known to which players.
- Campaign Guide: Information in the Campaign Guide cannot be examined by Rebel players. The Imperial
player may examine any information in the Campaign Guide at any time.
Rebel players may ask the Imperial player about any rules read previously but are not allowed to know
information about mission events that have not yet triggered. Tile names are not hidden information.
Mission rules specify when deployment points become active and inactive, but their locations are hidden
from Rebel players. The Rebel players can observe where further deployments are placing figures to deduce
their approximate locations.
- Imperial Cards: Deployment cards in the Imperial player's hand and reserve are kept secret from the Rebel
players. Since  and  Deployment cards have different backs, the Rebel players know how many of
each are in the Imperial player's hand of deployment cards and in reserved groups. Some Agenda cards are
kept secret from the Rebel players when purchased and are not shown to the Rebel players until played.
- Other Cards: Players cannot look at the cards in any deck except for the Reward deck. Discarded cards,
active missions, faceup cards on the table, and cards in players' play areas are open information and may be
read by any player at any time.
- Tokens: Crate, neutral mission, and terminal tokens often have hidden information on one side of the
token. Players cannot look at the facedown side of these tokens.
- Choices: When the mission event provides the Imperial player choice between options, only the chosen
option is read to the Rebel players.
When a mission event provides a choice to the Rebel players, the Imperial player reads only the portions of
that mission event that corresponds to the option chosen.
- Return to Hoth follows the same standards for information hidden from the Rebel players as the core game,
with the following addition:
- The end of a story mission may instruct the Imperial player to put the next Story Mission card into play
facedown. The text on a facedown Story Mission card is hidden information to Rebel players. When the
Rebel players need to resolve a story mission, and the active Story Mission card is facedown, that card
is turned faceup and is no longer hidden information.
- During the Heart of the Empire campaign, the Imperial player may be given the option to make narrative
choices as the result of mission rewards. For that reason, in the mission guide portion, the Imperial player is
not allowed to read beyond the story mission whose card is currently in play as the active mission.

## HOSTILE FIGURE

All figures belonging to a player's opponent are considered hostile.
- During a campaign, all  figures are considered hostile to all  and  figures.
- When playing regular or Four-Player Free-For-All skirmish, all other players are opponents, and all of their
figures are hostile figures.
- During a Four-Player Team Battle skirmish, the players on your immediate left and right are your
opponents and the remaining player is your teammate. All figures belonging to opponents are hostile, and
all figures belonging to teammates are friendly.
Related Topics: Affiliation 6, Friendly Figure 33, Imperial Figures 35

## ICON TYPES

Some abilities refer to an icon's type.  and  are attack icons. , , and  are defense icons.
Related Topics: Dice Types 27

## IMPASSABLE TERRAIN

Impassable terrain is represented by a dashed red line surrounding a space of the map. A figure cannot enter a
space containing impassable terrain unless an ability allows this, such as Massive or Mobile.
- Sometimes impassable terrain is only on one edge of a space. Figures cannot move, be pushed through, or
be placed on (if a Large figure) an impassable edge unless they have a special ability that allows this, such
as Massive (p.41) or Mobile (p.47).
- Line of sight can be traced through impassable terrain.
Related Topics: Line of Sight 40, Massive 41, Mobile 47, Movement 47, Place 50,
Push 51, Terrain 60

## IMPERIAL FIGURES

During a campaign, all figures belonging to the Imperial player are Imperial figures. This includes all
Deployment cards with an  or  icon under the Imperial player's control.
Related Topics: Activation 4, Deployment Cards 26, Elite Figure 28, Group 33

## IMPERIAL UPGRADE STAGE

During a campaign, the Imperial player can purchase new cards during each Imperial Upgrade Stage. The
imperial player can first spend experience points to purchase new Class cards and then influence to purchase
new Agenda cards.
- To purchase Class cards, the Imperial player examines all cards in their Class deck and may purchase as
many cards as the player wishes by spending XP equal to the cards' costs. Once purchased, the player
retains the cards for the remainder of the campaign.
- To purchase Agenda cards, the Imperial player shuffles the Agenda deck and secretly draws four of them.
The player may purchase any of these cards by spending influence equal to the cards' costs.
- The Imperial player does not show their drawn Agenda cards to the heroes. Any cards the player does
not purchase are shuffled back into the deck without being revealed.
- Most Agenda cards are immediately read aloud and resolved when purchased. The only exception is if
the card instructs the player to "keep this card secret." The Imperial player keeps the card and resolves
the effect when playing it (see "Types of Agenda Cards" on page 6).

## INCAPACITATED

Some mission rules refer to a figure being incapacitated, most often when a figure is defeated. Instead of being
removed from the map, the figure remains on the map and gains a number of restrictions.
- The figure remains under the control of the same player.
- The figure does not restrict movement or block line of sight. Other figures cannot end their movement in a
space containing an incapacitated figure.
- When a figure is incapacitated, it discards all conditions, and conditions cannot be applied to that figure.
- The figure cannot suffer  (damage) or be targeted or affected by attacks, abilities, or any game effect
except as specified by the mission's rules. The abilities of the figure are no longer available.
- The figure can still be pushed by a massive figure ending its movement in the incapacitated figure's space.
Related Topics: Massive 41, Missions 43, Withdraw 63

## INFLUENCE

During a campaign, the Imperial player is often rewarded influence. This resource is used to purchase Agenda
cards during the Imperial Upgrade Stage.
- Influence is tracked on the campaign log.
- When the Imperial player gains influence, the player adds it to the current influence on the campaign log
and records this new total. When the imperial player spends influence, the player subtracts it from the
current influence on the campaign log and records this new total.
- The imperial player does not have to spend all of their influence at once. Unspent influence may be spent
during future Imperial Upgrade Stages.
Related Topics: Agenda Cards 6, Imperial Upgrade Stage 35

## INITIAL GROUPS

During a campaign, most missions provide the Imperial player certain Deployment cards called initial groups.
The figures for these groups are placed according to the map in the mission's diagram.
- These cards are not part of their open group hand and are placed faceup at the start of the mission.
- Initial groups are deployed during mission setup, so the Imperial player can add attachments to them.
- When the last figure in an initial non-unique group is defeated, the corresponding Deployment card is
placed in the Imperial player's hand. The imperial player can Deploy these groups during optional
deployments following normal deployment rules.
Related Topics: Attachments 10, Deployment 25, Reinforce 53

## INITIATIVE

During a skirmish, one player has the initiative token each game round. The player with initiative resolves the
first activation during that game round.
- At the start of a mission, the player who has the lowest total cost of Deployment cards chooses which
player begins the game with the initiative token. In the case of a tie, players determine initiative randomly.
The player with initiative will choose deployment zones and resolve the first activation during the first
round.
- The player with initiative breaks all ties for mission rules. For example, if the mission rule moves a token
one space toward the closest figure and there are two figures equidistant, the player with initiative chooses
which figure the token moves toward.
Related Topics: Conflicts 22, Deployment 25, Skirmish 55, Status Phase 57


## INTERACT

Figures can interact to perform a variety of different tasks. For example, a figure can open a door by
performing an interact.
- A figure can perform an interact as an action.
- A figure must be in the same space as or adjacent to an object in order to interact with it.
- During a campaign, a hero can interact with a crate token to claim the token and draw one Supply card.
- Mission rules will often list different tasks that can be performed by interacting, such as using terminals or
retrieving tokens.
- If the mission rules have an attribute icon in parentheses after the target of the interact, the figure must pass
the corresponding attribute test in order to resolve the effect of the interact.
Related Topics: Actions 4, Activation 4, Attribute Tests 14, Doors 27, Crate
Tokens 23, Retrieving Tokens 54, Supply Cards 59, Terminal Tokens 59

## INTERIOR SPACES

Some spaces are considered interior spaces and are referred to by some mission rules or keywords such as
Massive.
- Interior spaces form the following tiles:
- Core game tiles 19A-36A and 19B-37B
- Return to Hoth tiles 01B-20B and 22B-24B
- Twin Shadows tiles 01A-07A and 01B-03B
- The Bespin Gambit tiles 01A-10A and 01B-12B
- Jabba's Realm tiles 02A, 07A, 10A, 13A, 15A, 17A, 01B-02B, 05B, 07B, 09B-13B, 15B, 17B
- Heart of the Empire tiles 01A-12A,15A-18A
- Tyrants of Lothal tiles  01A, 03A-08A, 11A-12A, 03B, 08B, 11B
- During a campaign, figures with the Massive keyword cannot enter interior spaces.
- Any space that is not an interior space is an exterior space.
- All spaces on tiles 38A, 39A, 38B and 39B are exterior spaces.
Related Topics: Massive 41, Tile Types 61

## INTERRUPT

Some abilities use the term interrupt. When resolving an interrupt ability, players pause the current action of the
game and resolve the interrupting ability. After the effect is resolved, players resume playing from the point
that was interrupted. For example, if an attack is interrupted, the interrupting ability is fully resolved before
players finish resolving the attack.
- It is possible for a figure to interrupt its own activation.
- If an interrupt makes the current action or ability invalid, that effect is not resolved. Any costs used to
resolve that effect are still paid.
For example, if a player plays a Command card that allows it to attack a figure, and the figure interrupts to
move out of line of sight, the Command card is discarded and the action spent on the attack is lost.
- A figure's action cannot be interrupted while the figure is in a space containing another figure.
Related Topics: Conflicts 22


## ITEM CARDS

During a campaign, heroes gain access to a wide range of Item cards. Item cards include weapons, armor,
equipment, and modifications. All Item cards that a hero has are placed faceup in their play area.
- Weapons are identified by having the word "Attack" listed in a box above dice icons and a  or  icon.
Weapons are used to perform attacks. Each other Item card is used as instructed on the card.
- Abilities on a weapon cannot be used while resolving an attack with a different weapon.
- There are three decks of Item cards, differentiated by card back. The numeral on the back of the Item card
is the card's tier. During the Rebel Upgrade Stage, Rebel players draw a number of Item cards from the tier
deck listed in the Campaign Log.
- Some Class cards and Reward cards are also Item cards. These cards are identified as Item cards by their
card face. Each hero in the core set has one starting Item card in their Class deck.
- Before deploying heroes to a mission, players may trade Item cards between heroes. Class cards and
Reward cards (that are assigned to heroes) cannot be traded between heroes. Item cards cannot be traded
while resolving a mission.
- There is no limit to the number of Item cards a hero can have; however, each hero is limited in what the
hero can bring to an individual mission: 1 Armor (), 2 Weapons, and 3 Equipment ().
- If a hero exceeds this limit after deploying their hero to the map, the player must choose which cards to
leave behind. Place the chosen cards aside; they cannot be used during this mission. These cards are
returned to the player at the end of the mission.
- If a hero brings 2 weapons to a mission, when the hero declares their attack, the hero must choose 1 of the
weapons to use for that attack.
- Item cards list a number of traits under the artwork (such as PISTOL). Traits have no gameplay effect but
may be referred to by other components.

## MODIFICATIONS

Some Item cards have the MODIFICATION trait. These cards have no effect on their own and must be attached to
(placed on) an Item card matching its icon (either  or ). Once attached to an item, the hero can use the
modification's ability while performing an attack with that weapon.
- Each weapon is limited in the number of modifications that can be attached to it. This limit is listed as a
number of colored bars on the bottom-right corner of the card. If an Item card does not have any
modification bars, modifications cannot be attached to it.
- Modifications are not weapons.
- When a hero purchases an Item card, and before each mission, heroes may attach any of their modifications
to other Item cards. Heroes may also choose to remove modifications from their Item cards and keep them
in their play area unattached. Abilities on modifications that are not attached to Item cards cannot be used.
- While resolving a mission, modifications cannot be attached to or removed from Item cards.
- An Item card cannot have more than one modification with the same trait attached to it at the same time,
excluding the MODIFICATION trait. For example, a weapon can only have one BARREL modification attached
to it.

## KEYWORDS

Keywords are shorthands for longer abilities.
- The following keywords are used: Blast, Cleave, Habitat, Massive, Mobile, Pierce, Recover, Reach.
- Condition keywords Bleed, Focus, Hide, Stun, and Weaken are used during attacks to apply the
corresponding condition (Bleeding, Focused, Hidden, Stunned, Weakened) after the attack resolves if the
target suffered damage from the attack. Abilities may also apply the conditions directly.
Related Topics: Blast 15, Cleave 19, Conditions 22, Habitat 33, Massive 41,
Mobile 47, Pierce 50, Recover 52, Reach 51

## LARGE FIGURES

Any figure whose base is larger than one space is a large figure. Large figures must obey the special rules listed
below and shown in Appendix II on page 67.
- When a large figure attacks, line of sight may be traced from any of the spaces it occupies. When a large
figure is targeted by an attack, the figure performing the attack must choose one of the spaces the large
figure occupies as the target space.
- Large figures cannot move diagonally.
- A large figure may spend one movement point to rotate 90 degrees (note that this is only necessary for
figures with bases that occupy two or six spaces). When rotating, the large figure must still occupy at least
half of the spaces it occupied before the rotation.
- When a large figure moves or rotates, it exits all spaces it occupied and then enters all of its new spaces,
even if some of those spaces overlap.
- When a large figure is pushed or moves a set number of spaces, its base cannot rotate and must retain its
current orientation.
- Large figures are subject to all movement requirements for terrain and other figures, but they are subject to
these requirements only once per each moved space.
- For example, if an E-Web Engineer moves into two spaces containing hostile figures, it must only
spend one additional movement point instead of two.
- If an effect places a large figure in a space, the player resolving the effect chooses the figure's orientation. It
can be placed in any legal spaces as long as one of the figure's spaces enters the space instructed.

## LINE OF SIGHT

Line of sight is used to determine what a figure can "see." Line of sight is most often used to determine which
figures or objects can be targeted by a figure for a  (ranged) attack.
To determine line of sight to a target, the player draws imaginary, non-intersecting and non-overlapping lines
from one corner of the space the figure using the ability (for example attacking) is occupying to two adjacent
corners of the target's space. If either of these lines passes through or the area between them (outside of the
target space) contains a wall, door, non-companion figure, energy shield, or blocking terrain, then the figure
does not have line of sight to the target.
- If the figure determining line of sight is Large, any of the spaces it occupies can be used to draw line of
sight from. If the target is a Large figure or an object occupying multiple spaces, any of their spaces can be
chosen to draw line of sight to. (Also see “Attacks” p.13.)
- Line of sight can be traced from or to any corner on the map. Each line can be traced along the corners and
edges of spaces containing figures, doors, energy shields, walls, and blocking terrain.
- Graphical details of the tiles are ignored when drawing line of sight. Walls only block line of sight along an
entire edge of a space. If a wall does not cover an entire edge, then line of sight may be traced to, from, and
through that edge and corner. (“Line of Sight Examples” p.65)
- Line of sight cannot be traced through a corner where any combination of walls, doors, blocking terrain, or
Energy Shield intersect. It can be traced to and from a corner where the combination of one figure and a
diagonally positioned wall, door, blocking terrain, Energy Shield, or other figure intersect.
- It is possible for a figure to have line of sight to another figure that does not have line of sight back. This
most often happens when a figure is behind a wall or figure. Thematically, this represents a figure leaning
out of cover to make an attack and then ducking back behind cover.
- A figure does not block line of sight to itself. The target figure also does not block line of sight.
- Thus, figures are always able to draw line of sight to adjacent figures and objects (except sometimes not
doors), and to figures and objects in the same space, including themselves.
- Figures do not block line of sight to or from Massive figures.
- A blocking edge, door, or wall connecting the two chosen corners of the target space blocks line of sight if
it is between the target space and the corner from which line of sight is being drawn.
- Line of sight can be drawn to a figure or object that is occupying blocking terrain. (See “Blocking Terrain”
p.15, “Massive” p.41, “Mobile” p.47)
Most of the above situations are shown in detail in "Appendix I - Line of Sight Examples" on page 65 and
“Appendix IV – Energy Shield Examples” on page 69.

## LOCKED

See "Doors" on page 27.

## MAP DIAGRAM

The map diagram of each mission indicates assembly for the map, as well as placement of tokens, doors, and
figures. It also displays information referenced by mission rules, such as named map tiles or deployment points.
Note: Figures shown with gray and black borders both correspond to a gray Deployment card, but belong to
different groups.
Related Topics: Mission Setup 44


## MASSIVE

The Massive keyword is found on some Deployment cards and applies special rules to figures in that group.
- Figures do not block line of sight to or from a Massive figure.
- During a campaign, Massive figures cannot enter interior spaces (p.37).
- Massive figures ignore terrain for movement, thus can enter spaces containing blocking terrain and
impassable terrain. They can also move through and end movement on blocked or impassable terrain edges.
- Massive figures can enter spaces containing hostile figures and/or difficult terrain at no additional
movement cost.
- Massive figures cannot enter spaces containing other Massive figures.
- A Massive figure can end its movement in spaces that contain blocking terrain and/or other figures. Any
figures in its spaces are pushed the least amount of spaces (its controller's choice if tied) to reach a space
where it can end movement. The player moving the Massive figure pushes friendly figures first, and then
other players push their figures.
- Mobile affects the push and where the figure can end movement.
- If a Massive figure ends movement on a Large figure, that Large figure is pushed to a valid position
that requires the least spaces of pushed movement. Note that while pushing a large figure, it cannot
move diagonally and cannot be rotated. If the figure cannot reach a valid position by being pushed,
place (p.50) it in a valid position that is the least number of spaces away (“Counting Spaces” p.23).
- When a Massive figure is placed e.g. during a deployment it is considered to have ended its movement.
This means that unless another Massive figure is on the deployment point, a deployed Massive figure
will usually deploy directly to the point, pushing all other figures aside.
- After a Massive figure ends its movement in spaces containing at least one other figure during an
activation, Start of Round, or End of Round, the Massive figure cannot voluntarily move any more during
that activation, Start of Round, or End of Round.
- If a Massive figure occupies a space containing blocking terrain, line of sight can be traced to that figure,
spaces can be counted to that figure, and adjacent figures can attack that figure.

## MELEE ATTACK

Some Deployment cards and Item cards are marked with the  icon. This icon means that the figures can
perform melee attacks.
- Melee attacks can target a hostile figure or object adjacent to or in the same space as the attacker.
- Accuracy is not required while performing melee attacks.
- If a figure does not have the  icon, it cannot perform melee attacks. An attack targeting an adjacent figure
that uses the  icon is a ranged attack, not a melee attack.
- A  (melee) attack with the Reach keyword can target figures or objects in line of sight and within 2
spaces.
Related Topics: Accuracy 4, Adjacent 6, Attacks 10, Reach 51


## MINI CAMPAIGNS

In addition to being usable in a full campaign, the missions included in Twin Shadows, The Bespin Gambit, and
Tyrants of Lothal expansions can be played in succession to form a narrative mini campaign that requires only
6-8 hours to complete.
Playing a mini campaign is similar to playing a full campaign. The missions used to make up the story of the
mini campaign are all considered to be story missions and are played in a specific order. Side missions are not
played during the mini campaign unless playing an Expanded Mini campaign.
During the Mission Stage (p.46), Rebel players do not choose the next mission to resolve based upon active
Side or Story Mission cards. Each mission's epilogue (p.29) will determine the next active mission to be
resolved, so there is always just one active mission.

## EXPANDING THE MINI CAMPAIGNS

The Bespin Gambit mini campaign can be expanded by playing the mission “Into the Unknown” from the ISB
Infiltrators pack as a forced mission immediately after the second mission of the campaign before the updgrade
stages.
The Tyrants of Lothal mini campaign can be expanded using side missions found in its associated Ally and
Villain packs to create a longer campaign.
- Players may expand the Tyrants of Lothal mini campaign using some or all of these missions. If they do,
use the optional side mission elements of the campaign log. Otherwise, ignore those rows in the campaign
log (including upgrade stages).
- The Ally and Villain packs involved in the expanded campaign include Epilogue cards. These provide
epilogues to the missions contained in the figure packs. All rules that apply to epilogues also apply to the
Epilogue cards. The epilogue cards are not used if the missions are used as side missions.
Related Topics: Campaign Log 17, Campaign Setup 18

## MISS

Some effects can cause an attack to miss. When an attack misses, the target suffers zero  (damage).
- The  (dodge) icon found on the white die causes the attack to miss.
- While performing a ranged attack, the attack requires Accuracy greater than or equal to the distance to the
target. If the total Accuracy is less than this distance, then the attack misses.
- When an attack misses, other effects can still be triggered (such as using the Recover keyword). If the
ability requires the target figure to suffer one or more , such as Blast, Cleave, and a Condition keyword,
a miss prevents that ability from being resolved, because the target suffers no damage.
Related Topics: Accuracy 4, Attacks 10, Counting Spaces 23


## MISSION EVENTS

Events form the initial structure and changing rules of a given mission. A mission can consist of any number of
events starting with “Mission Briefing” and concluding with “End of Mission”.
Each event can contain any combination of story text and additional rules that apply to the mission. When an
event is triggered, all of the text and rule information for that event is read aloud and resolved, in order.
Mission rules are instant (►) or ongoing ( ) effects. An instant effect is resolved immediately and most often	◆
no longer needs to be referenced. An ongoing effect applies throughout the mission and often determines
special abilities granted to the Rebel or Imperial figures.
- In some cases, an event will require the Imperial player to choose one of a number of effects, which can be
instant or ongoing. When the player chooses one option, the player reads the effect aloud and resolves it,
but does not read or resolve any of the effects that were not chosen.
When a mission event provides a choice to the Rebel players, the Imperial player reads only the portions of
that mission event that corresponds to the option chosen.
- When the Imperial player deploys an initial or reserved group, this does not cost any  (threat). Reserved
groups can only be deployed by mission rules. When a rule allows the Imperial player to resolve an
optional deployment, such as during the Status Phase, the imperial player must spend  normally.
- While resolving an optional deployment, the Imperial player can also reinforce figures (p.53) corresponding
to groups already on the map.
- Certain rules reference the mission ending or progressing, followed by the  symbol. This indicates that
the preceding text is an objective that the heroes are attempting to fulfill, which should be emphasized to
the Rebel players by the Imperial Player.
- The rebels can always ask the imperial player to repeat the text or rules of an event that has happened.

## MISSIONS

Each mission is a game of tactical combat and trying to fulfill the mission objective played on a modular game
map and featuring unique mission rules.

## RESOLVING A MISSION

Missions in Imperial Assault are played over a number of game rounds. Each round consists of an Activation
Phase (“Activation” p.4) followed by a Status Phase (“Status Phase” p.57). Mission events provide surprises
and new objectives during a mission.
After resolving the Status Phase, play proceeds to the next round, starting with an Activation Phase. These
phases are repeated until the mission ends (see "Winning the Game" on page 63).

## STORY AND SIDE MISSIONS

During a campaign, players resolve a series of alternating story and side missions accoding to the respective
campaign log (p.17). The rules and maps for each mission are found in the Campaign Guide or Rulesheet.
- During each "Mission Stage” p.46, the heroes choose and resolve one active mission.
- A mission cannot be played twice during a campaign.
- Side Mission cards list a number of traits under the name (such as TATOOINE). Traits have no gameplay
effect but may be referred to by other components.

## FORCED MISSIONS

Forced Missions (p.31) are additional missions inserted to the normal sequence of campaign missions.

## SKIRMISH MISSIONS

The map for each skirmish mission is shown in that mission's diagram. The rules for each skirmish mission are
listed on Skirmish Mission cards.

## MISSION SETUP

Before resolving a mission, players perform a number of setup steps.

## CAMPAIGN MISSION SETUP

To setup a campaign mission, perform the following steps.
1. Assemble Map: The Imperial player assembles the mission's map using map tiles as shown in the
Campaign Guide or Rulesheet. The imperial player places all tokens on the map as indicated in the map
diagram (including tokens that are defined to be figures by the mission rule in the Mission Briefing).
2. Prepare Threat and Round Dial: The Imperial player sets the  dial to zero and the round dial to one.
3. Deployment and Setup: The Imperial player takes all Deployment cards and sorts them as listed in the
"Deployment and Setup" box of the mission rules. This box has up to four different elements:
- Initial Groups: The imperial player takes the listed Deployment cards and places them faceup on the
table in their play area.
- Reserved Groups: The imperial player secretly takes the listed Deployment cards, and places them in a
facedown pile out of the way in their play area.
- Open Groups: The imperial player secretly chooses a number of Deployment cards as listed in the
"Open Groups" section and places them in their hand.
- The imperial player may choose any non-Rebel Deployment cards not used in the initial or
reserved groups. The imperial player cannot choose a villain that they have not gained as a reward.
- When choosing open groups, the mission may list specific groups or traits (such as CREATURES) that
cannot be chosen.
- Deployment cards not in initial, reserved, or open groups are returned to the game box and not used
during this mission.
- When collecting the listed Deployment cards, figures listed in red text refer to the elite (red) version of
the Deployment card and all other figures use a regular (grey) version of the Deployment card.
- Special Setup: Follow any rules listed in this section. Many missions do not have special setup rules.
4. Deploy Imperial Figures: The Imperial player deploys figures on the map as indicated in the diagram.
- If the figure shown on the map has a gray or black border, the figures correspond to a gray Deployment
card. The different border colors differentiate between two initial regular groups.
5. Prepare Dice, Cards, and Other Tokens: Place all dice, the Condition cards and Supply deck, damage
tokens, strain tokens, and condition tokens within easy reach of all players.
6. Read Mission Briefing: The Imperial player reads the flavor text and rules from the "Mission Briefing"
section aloud to all players. (See “Mission Events” p.43 and “Hidden Information” p.34)
7. Deploy Rebel Figures: Rebel players places all hero figures in the space containing and as close as
possible to the entrance token. This includes the space containing the entrance token (p.29).
- Rebel players choose the order in which their figures are deployed. Before placing their figures, they
choose the Item cards (p.38) that they will bring to the mission. Each hero may bring up to 1 Armor
(), 2 Weapons, and 3 Equipment ().
- After deploying hero figures, Rebel players may choose to deploy an ally that they have gained as a
reward ("Rebel Allies" p.8).
- If the Rebel players chose to deploy an ally, the Imperial player gains  and can perform an optional
deployment. (see “Rebel Allies” p.8 for details).
8. Prepare Activation Tokens: Each hero receives one activation token and places it ready (green side
faceup) on their Hero sheet. When playing with 2 or 3 heroes, Legendary or Heroic Reward cards give
more activation tokens (“Campaign Setup” p.18).
Then the campaign mission starts with the first activation phase (“Activation” p.4). Rebel players perform the
first activation.


## SKIRMISH MISSION SETUP

To set up a skirmish mission, perform the following steps.
1. Bring Armies and Command Cards: Both players simultaneously place their Deployment cards faceup
in their play areas. Then each player shuffles their deck of 15 Command cards and places it by their
Deployment cards.
2. Determine Initiative: The player who has the lowest total cost of Deployment cards chooses which player
begins the game with the initiative token. In the case of a tie, players determine initiative randomly.
3. Determine and set up Skirmish Mission: The player with initiative shuffles their deck of Skirmish
Mission cards and draws one card. If playing Four-Player Skirmish, use a deck that includes only Skirmish
mission cards corresponding to four-player skirmish maps. The drawn card lists the name of the mission,
which map it is played on, and the special rules for the mission. During tournament, the tournament rules
define how to determine the mission to play.
- After determining the mission, players refer to the matching skirmish mission's diagram, and then build
the map and place tokens on it as shown.
- Player's place only the "A" or "B" tokens on the map that match the Skirmish Mission card's letter.
4. Deploy Units: The player with initiative chooses one of the deployment zone shown on the skirmish
mission's diagram. If playing two-player skirmish, red or blue deployment zones are available. If playing
Four-Player Skirmish, also yellow and green deployment zones exist. The player with initiative deploys all
of their figures in the chosen deployment zone.
The player to their left does the same, choosing from the remaining deployment zones, and so on until all
players have deployed.
If all of a player's figures do not fit in their deployment zone, the player must remove and redeploy figures
to fill as many spaces of this zone as possible. Then the player deploys any remaining figures as close to
the deployment zone as possible (see "Counting Spaces" on page 23).
5. Draw Command Cards: Set the round dial to one. Each player draws three cards from their Command
deck.

Deployment Cards 26, Skirmish 55


## MISSION STAGE

During a campaign, players choose and resolve missions during the Mission Stage of the campaign log (p.17).
The Mission Stage consists of the following steps:
1. Choose Mission: Rebel players refer to the campaign log to determine the next mission. If this reads "Side
Mission," the heroes choose one of the active Side Mission cards. If this reads "Story Mission," they must
choose an active Story Mission card. There may be just one active mission of the required type.
- Active missions that are not chosen are saved between sessions and remain active until resolved.
- During the Heart of the Empire campaign, after the heroes choose a Story Mission to resolve, return all
other active Story Mission cards to the game box.
2. Resolve Mission: Players resolve the chosen mission starting with Mission Setup (p.44). At the end they
receive rewards (p.54) from the “End of Mission” event and from the “Additional Rewards” section.
3. Post-Mission Cleanup: After resolving the mission, players perform the following:
- Wounded heroes flip their hero sheets to the healthy side. Heroes recover all  (damage) and  (strain).
- Heroes shuffle all of their Supply cards back into the Supply deck.
- Heroes gain 50 credits for each crate token claimed during the mission and then discard the tokens.
- Unless otherwise specified by abilities or rules (see Bounty tokens p.16), all other tokens are discarded.
- Return the Mission card corresponding to the mission that was just resolved to the game box.
- If players just resolved the introductory mission, shuffle the Side Mission deck, draw two cards, and
place them faceup on the table. If playing the Return to Hoth campaign, also draw two cards from the
Threat Mission deck, place them faceup with the Side Mission cards, then put the Bane cards they
specify to play. These are now active missions.
- If players just resolved a non-agenda, non-threat Side Mission (drawn from the side mission deck), draw
a random card from the Side Mission deck and place it faceup on the table. It is now an active mission.
- If players just resolved a side mission (including threat mission or agenda side mission), resolve the
instructions on each remaining active agenda side mission card.
After resolving "Post-Mission Cleanup," players proceed to the next stage listed on the campaign log. The next
stage is usually the Rebel Upgrade Stage unless the resolved mission was a forced mission.

Upgrade Stage 52, Threat Missions 60

## MISSION TOKENS

These tokens are used to represent objects, people, or general points of interest.
Mission tokens have no inherent effects and act as specified in the mission.
- There are three types of mission tokens. Mission tokens showing a  or a  icon are referred to as Rebel
and Imperial mission tokens, respectively. All other mission tokens are neutral mission tokens.
- Mission tokens do not block line of sight or affect figure movement. Figures can enter and end their
movement in the same space as a mission token.
- If a mission token is in a space containing terrain, the terrain in the space still takes effect. E.g., a space of
blocking terrain that contains a mission token still blocks line of sight, and figures cannot enter the space.
- The colored border of mission tokens has no game effect unless specified by the mission. A neutral mission
token with its colored side down cannot be examined. The color is hidden information.
Related Topics: Control 23, Hidden Information 34, Interact 37


## MOBILE

Figures that have the Mobile keyword ignore additional movement point costs when entering difficult terrain
and spaces containing hostile figures. They ignore terrain for movement, so can move through and enter
impassable and blocking terrain, and can end movement in a space containing impassable or blocking terrain.
- If a figure with Mobile occupies a space containing blocking terrain, line of sight can be traced to that
figure, spaces can be counted to that figure, and adjacent figures can attack that figure.
Related Topics: Blocking Terrain 15, Counting Spaces 23, Keywords 39, Line of
Sight 40, Massive 41, Terrain 60

## MODIFICATIONS

See "Item Cards" on page 38.

## MOVEMENT

All figures move one space at a time. Large figures cannot move diagonally. There are two basic ways for a
figure to move: move X spaces, and by spending movement points for each space moved. (See also “Place” on
page 50 and “Push” on page 51.)
When a figure performs a move (for example by using the Move action), it gains movement points equal to its
Speed. Gaining movement points doesn't move the figure. The Move action finishes immediately after granting
the movement points. Movement points can also be gained from other sources than the Move action. (See
“Movement Points”, page 48.)
- Figures with Massive (p.41) or Mobile (p.47) ignore terrain for their movement (“Movement Examples”, p.
67), other figures cannot move or be pushed into or through blocking or impassable terrain.
- Figures cannot move through walls or doors.
- Performing a move does not move the figure; it only provides movement points that may be spent during
that figure's activation to move the figure. This means that a figure may use its first action to perform a
move (which finishes immediately after giving the movement points), followed by another action such as
an attack, and then spend the movement points. The figure may even spend some movement points before
the attack and then some of them after the attack.
- Figures can move diagonally along the corner of any individual wall, door, blocking terrain, or impassable
terrain, but a figure cannot move through the diagonal intersection of any combination of wall, door,
blocking terrain, or impassable terrain (see "Appendix II - Movement Examples" on page 67).
- A Large figure may rotate 90° by spending one movement point, but additional movement point costs may
apply if the figure does not have Massive or Mobile. (See “Large Figures” on page 39 for details.)
- Move X Spaces: If an ability moves a figure a listed number of spaces, this movement ignores movement
point costs. All other effects of terrain and figures apply, for example the figure cannot end its movement in
another figure's space. Usually abilities use the forms “move up to X spaces” and “may move 1 space”. You
cannot save movement from move X spaces for later. When moving in this way, a large figure's base cannot
rotate and must retain its orientation.
- Figures can move through other figures' spaces. The figure must spend one additional movement point to
enter a space containing a hostile figure.
When moving through a space the figure can enter the space as long as the figure does not end its
movement in the space. A figure can only enter a space if it can end movement legally.
- A figure must spend one additional movement point to enter a space that contains difficult terrain.
- There are rare situations where a figure can lose all of its movement points or become unable to spend
movement points (by becoming Stunned) while in a space where it cannot end its movement (such as in
another non-companion figure's space). In this situation, push (see “Push” p.51) the moving figure to the
closest valid space (the figure's controller's choice if there are more than one).


- Large figures have additional movement restrictions. See "Large Figures" on page 39 and "Appendix II -
Movement Examples" on page 67.
- Movement points received outside of a figure's own activation must be spent immediately or be lost.

## MOVEMENT POINTS

There are numerous methods by which a figure can gain movement points. Moving to an adjacent space costs a
figure one movement point. Entering a space occupied by a hostile figure costs an additional movement point.
Each space containing difficult terrain also costs an additional movement point to enter.
- Any time a figure gains movement points during its activation, they are added to the remaining total of
movement points that figure possesses (movement point pool).
- A figure is not required to spend all of the movement points it possesses, but at the end of its activation, it
loses all of its remaining movement points.
- Spending movement points is not an action and may be done at any time during the figure's activation
(p.28). They can be spent before or after performing any action but cannot be spent while resolving an
action or another ability.
- If a figure gains movement points when it is not its activation, those movement points must be spent
immediately as an interrupt or be lost. If a figure gains movement points as part of a special action, they
must be spent during that special action.
- Movement points are an intangible resource that are not tracked by tokens. When a figure gains movement
points, the player announces how many movement points their figure has and counts out loud as the player
spends movement points.
- During a campaign, a hero can suffer 1 (strain) during their activation to gain one movement point. The
hero may do this up to twice per activation.

## MOVING THROUGH

See "Movement" on page 47.

## NEGATIVE DEPLOYMENT COST

In a skirmish, some Skirmish Upgrade cards in Heart of the Empire feature a negative deployment cost. When a
player includes a card with a negative deployment cost in their army, it modifies the total deployment cost of
the rest of the Deployment cards selected. So, if a player includes a card with a cost of -4, the player could
include additional Deployment cards with a total cost up to 44.
If a card with a negative deployment cost is an attachment, the other Deployment cards selected for the army
must include at least one eligible card onto which it can be attached. When a group with an attachment with a
negative deployment cost is defeated, the VPs scored are modified by that card's negative cost.
Related Topics: Skirmish Attachments 56

## NEGATIVE SYMBOLS

Attribute tests and attacks can gain negative versions of symbols for example from mission rules, weapons and
modifications, or conditions such as Weakened (-1 while defending and -1 while attacking). If a positive
and negative version of the same symbol exist in the attribute test results or in the attack/defense results, they
eliminate each other immediately. A negative version of a symbol doesn't have any other effect.
Related Topics: Attacks 10, Attribute Tests 14


## NEUTRAL DEPLOYMENT CARDS

Deployment cards with a Neutral icon () and card back do not belong to any affiliation. When creating an
army for a skirmish, a player may choose to include Neutral Deployment cards as if they belonged to their
affiliation.
Neutral Deployment cards cannot be used in a campaign.
Related Topics: Affiliation 6

## NEUTRAL FIGURES

During a campaign, some figures are denoted as neutral. These figures are only present in specific missions.
The additional rules regarding these figures are described in the mission.
- No player controls a neutral figure. Neutral figures cannot activate or perform actions.
- These figures cannot suffer  (damage) or be targeted by attacks, abilities, or any game effect except as
explicitly specified by the mission's rules.
- Figures can move through spaces containing neutral figures at no additional movement point cost, but
figures cannot end movement in the same space (unless the figure is a companion 21 or has Massive).
- Neutral figures block line of sight.
Related Topics: Line of Sight 40, Massive 41, Movement 47

## OBJECTS

Objects refer to elements on the map that are not figures. Doors, crates, and terminals are all considered to be
objects.
- Most mission tokens are considered to be objects, unless the mission rules use the token to represent a
figure explicitly.
- Except for doors, objects do not restrict movement or block line of sight.
- Objects cannot be pushed.
- Mission rules can allow objects to be attacked by specified figures (see "Attacking Objects", page 13).
- Abilities that apply damage to objects only affect objects that can be attacked.

## OPEN GROUPS

During a campaign, most missions allow the Imperial player to choose a number of Deployment cards known
as open groups. The Imperial player starts the mission with these open groups as their hand of deployment
cards. Unique Imperial ( or ) Deployment cards (“Villains”, p.62) can only be included in open groups
once they have been gained as rewards.
- These Deployment cards are kept secret in the Imperial player's hand of deployment cards until deployed.
- The Imperial player can deploy groups from their hand of deployment cards during an optional deployment,
including during the Deploy and Reinforce step of the Status Phase.
- When the last figure in a non-unique group is defeated, the Deployment card returns to the Imperial
player's hand of Deployment cards.
Related Topics: Deployment 25, Deployment Cards 26, Group 33, Optional Deployment
49, Status Phase 57

## OPTIONAL DEPLOYMENT

In the campaign, optional deployments from mission rules and imperial abilities allow the imperial player to
optionally spend  (threat) to deploy groups and/or reinforce figures. The Deploy and Reinforce step of the
Status Phase is also an optional deployment.
Related Topics: Deployment 25, Deployment Cards 26, Group 33, Status Phase 57


## PAYING VPS

In a Skirmish, when an ability instructs a player to pay another player VPs, the paying player loses VPs and the
paid player gains an equal number of VPs.
- If using an ability requires a player to pay more VPs than that player has, that player cannot use that ability.
- If a player's ability requires an opponent to pay more VPs than they have, that opponent pays all of their
remaining VPs.
Related Topics: Victory Points 62, Winning the Game 63

## PIERCE

This keyword allows a figure to ignore a number of (block) results while attacking. For example, "Pierce 2"
allows an attack to ignore up to 2 results.
- If the number of  results is less than the Pierce value, the excess Pierce value has no effect.
- If multiple Pierce abilities are used during an attack, their values are added together.
Related Topics: Attacks 10, Keywords 39

## PLACE

Many effects place figures or tokens on specific spaces of the map.
- When a figure on the map is placed, it is removed from its current space and then placed where indicated.
- Placing a figure in a space requires no movement points.
- A player cannot choose to place a figure in a space where it cannot end its movement, such as in a space
containing another figure, blocking terrain, or impassable terrain (unless their ability allows it).
- When a figure is placed, it enters the space(s) where it is placed and exits the space(s) it occupied before.
- When a figure is placed, it ends movement.
Related Topics: Enter 29, Exit 30, Massive 41, Mobile 47, Movement 47, Terrain 60

## PLAY AREA

The table space in front of a player is known as their play area. This is where a player keeps all of their game
components that are not on the game map, including Hero sheet, Item cards, Deployment cards, Class cards,
claimed tokens, and more. The imperial player and each hero have separate play areas.
- Abilities on cards and on Hero sheets in a player's play area can be used as explained on the card or sheet.
- All faceup cards in a player's play area are open information and can be examined by any player.
- When a player controls more than one hero, each hero has their own play area.
Related Topics: Claim 19, Supply Cards 59

## POWER TOKENS

Various cards and abilities in Heart of the Empire, Tyrants of Lothal, and in the associated figure packs allow
figures to gain power tokens:  (surge power token),  (damage power token),  (evade power token),
 (block power token). Abilities also use the symbol  (wild power token).
When a figure with a power token declares an attack or is declared as the target of an attack, that figure may
spend 1 of its power tokens to apply +1 of the symbol on that token to the attack results. For example, if the
target spent 1, +1 gets added to the defense results.
A figure can only spend a power token of the appropriate type. The attacker cannot spend a power token that
adds  or  and the defender cannot spend a power token that adds  or . (From designers, but not in FAQ.)
When an ability instructs a figure to gain a specific power token, that figure's player picks a token of that type
from the supply and places it near that figure on the map, or on that figure's deployment card or hero sheet.
When an ability refers to the  (wild power token), the player can choose any power token.
Power tokens are not limited. If players run out of a token type, they should use a suitable replacement.
Each figure can only have up to 2 total power tokens. If a figure would gain more than 2, its player must choose
tokens to discard until the figure has 2. A figure cannot spend more than 1 power token per attack.
Related Topics: Attacks 10


## PUSH

Some abilities push figures. The player resolving this ability moves the figure the specified number of spaces
using the rules for move X spaces.
- The figure can be moved in any direction. It does not need to move directly away from the figure using the
push ability.
- A pushed figure is not voluntarily exiting its space.
- Pushing a figure requires no movement points, it uses the rules for move X spaces (no additional mp costs).
- If a non-ability effect pushes a figure, such as a mission rule or if a door closes between two spaces
occupied by a large figure, the player controlling that figure determines its placement.
- While pushing a large figure, it cannot move diagonally and cannot be rotated.
- When a figure with Massive or Mobile is pushed, the push ignores terrain, and a figure with Massive can
end movement when occupying spaces with another figure(s).
Related Topics: Exit 30, Large Figures 39, Movement 47

## RANGED ATTACK

Some Deployment cards and Item cards are marked with the  icon. This icon means that the figures can
perform ranged attacks.
- Ranged attacks can target any hostile figure (or object which can suffer damage) within line of sight of the
attacker.
- While performing a ranged attack, the attacker requires Accuracy equal to or greater than the number of
spaces away from the target. If the attacker does not have enough Accuracy results, the attack misses.
- While performing a ranged attack that targets an adjacent figure (or an object which can suffer damage), the
attacker requires at least 1 Accuracy result or the attack misses.
Related Topics: Accuracy 4, Attacks 10, Counting Spaces 23, Line of Sight 40, Miss 42

## REACH

A figure with the Reach keyword may perform  (melee) attacks that target figures or objects up to 2 spaces
away.
- The target of the attack must be within 2 spaces and in line of sight.
- An attack with Reach does not require Accuracy.
Related Topics: Attacks 10, Counting Spaces 23, Melee Attack 41

## READY

A ready figure is any figure that is eligible to be activated. Any card that is not exhausted is ready and may be
exhausted to trigger certain abilities.
- A hero is ready if the hero has at least one ready (green) activation token on their Hero sheet.
- When a Deployment card is ready, all figures of that card's group are ready.
- When a figure or card is readied, rotate its Deployment card to orient it upright. If the figure is a hero, flip
all of its activation tokens green side faceup instead.
- Deployment cards (Imperial groups and Rebel allies), all exhausted Imperial cards (Class cards, Agenda
cards, Imperial companion cards. Reward cards), and activation tokens of heroes are readied during the
Ready step of the Status Phase of each round. All exhausted cards of a hero are readied at the start of that
hero's activation.

Item Cards 38


## REBEL UPGRADE STAGE

During a campaign, heroes can purchase new cards during each Rebel Upgrade Stage. They can first spend
experience points to purchase new Class cards and can then spend credits to purchase new Item cards.
- To purchase Class cards, each Rebel player looks at all cards in the hero's Class deck and can purchase any
number of those cards.
- In order to purchase a Class card, the hero must spend a number of XP equal to the card's cost.
- Once purchased, the hero retains the cards for the remainder of the campaign.
- Players should make note of the total number of cards in each Item deck at the start of the campaign. If
playing with just the core game, the number is 12 for each deck. To purchase Item cards, Rebel players
shuffle the Item deck listed on the campaign log and draw a number of cards equal to half the starting size
(rounded up). The rebel players may purchase any number of those cards and return any unpurchased cards
to the deck.
- If multiple Item decks are listed on the campaign log, players shuffle and draw cards from each deck.
- In order to purchase an Item card, the Rebel players must spend credits equal to the card's cost.
- After purchasing an Item card, Rebel players give the Item card to the hero of their choice.
- Immediately before purchasing Item cards, heroes can sell any of the Item cards they already own. Each
sold card is returned to the game box. Then the heroes receive an amount of credits equal to half the
card's cost rounded up to the nearest 25.
- Item cards without a credit cost can be sold for the heroes to receive 50 credits.

Item Cards 38

## RECON TOKENS

The hero Loku Kanoloa uses recon tokens to scout the battlefield, giving both himself and their
fellow Rebels tactical advantages. These tokens have no inherent function and only interact with
abilities found on Loku Kanoloa's Hero sheet and Class cards.
During campaign setup, when Loku Kanoloa is chosen as a hero, place the two recon tokens near their play
area. During a mission, Loku's abilities allow him to place these tokens on various figures or locations for a
number of beneficial effects.
The total number of recon tokens that can be placed is limited by the included supply of two tokens. However,
if an ability allows Loku to place a recon token, the player may either use a token already in play, moving it
from its current position, or use one from their supply. Discarded tokens return to Loku's supply.
Related Topics: Hero 34

## RECOVER

Some abilities allow figures to recover  (damage) or  (strain). When a figure recovers damage or strain,
remove the listed amount of tokens from the figure or its Hero sheet.
- Some cards use Recover as a keyword. For example ": Recover 1" allows the figure to spend a 
(surge) during an attack to recover 1 after resolving the attack. The figure can recover this  even if the
target of their attack does not suffer any .
- In a campaign, while attacking a hero can spend a  (surge) to recover 1 . The  is recovered
immediately when the surge is spent (step 5 of the attack).
- If a hero recovers more  than the hero has suffered, the hero recovers one  for each  the hero cannot
recover. (This rule is not in effect when playing a Legends of the Alliance campaign.)
Related Topics: Damage 24, Keywords 39, Rest 54, Strain 58, Surges 59


## RE-DRAW

In a skirmish, some Command cards have ability text that allows a player to RE-DRAW it. Re-draw abilities are
active while the card is in the (your) discard pile. When a player re-draws a Command card, the player takes
that card from their discard pile and places it in their hand. That card may be played again normally.
Related Topics: Command Cards 20

## REINFORCE

During any optional deployment of a campaign, including the Deploy and Reinforce step of the Status Phase,
the Imperial player is able to place figures that were previously defeated back on the map. To reinforce, the
imperial player pays  (threat) equal to the figure's reinforcement cost, then places one figure from that group
as close as possible to any active deployment point.
- Some Deployment cards do not have a reinforcement cost. The corresponding figures cannot be reinforced.
Unless the figure is unique, it can be deployed again after being defeated.
- The reinforcement cost of a figure is listed on its Deployment card directly to the right of its deployment
cost.
- A figure can be reinforced only if at least one other figure from its group is on the map.
- The Imperial player can reinforce multiple figures during each Status Phase (including figures from the
same group), as long as the imperial player spends the  individually for each figure.
- The Imperial player cannot reinforce a figure from a group that has figures on the map equal to its group
limit.
Related Topics: Deployment 25, Group 33, Unique 62

## REPLACING TILES

Some missions will direct the Imperial player to replace one or more tiles in the map with other tiles previously
set aside. When this happens, the Imperial player removes the listed tile or tiles from the map. Then, the
imperial player connects the listed set-aside tiles to the newly exposed puzzle edge of the map.
If a figure or token is occupying a space on a removed tile, place it in the corresponding space of the
replacement tile. If there is no such space, place it in the nearest possible space instead.
Related Topics: Hidden Information 34, Terrain 60

## REROLL

When dice are rerolled, their old results are ignored and new results are used instead. Each die may be rerolled
only once per attack regardless of who is rerolling the die. (See "Attacks" on page 10.)
Limit is not defined for attribute test. Limiting rerolls to once per die per attribute test seems a good house rule.
Related Topics: Attacks 10, Attribute Tests 14

## RESERVED GROUPS

During a campaign, many missions provide the Imperial player certain Deployment cards called reserved
groups.
- These cards are not part of their hand of deployment cards and are kept facedown on the table. They cannot
be deployed or reinforced while facedown. Rebel players cannot look at reserved Deployment cards.
- Mission rules specify when and how these figures can be deployed to the map.
- Once deployed by a mission rule, the group is no longer considered a reserved group. So, when the last
figure in a non-unique group is defeated, the matching Deployment card is placed in the Imperial player's
hand. The imperial player can then deploy these figures during an optional deployment following normal
deployment rules.
Related Topics: Deployment 25, Hidden Information 34, Mission Setup 44


## REST

During a campaign, hero figures can perform an action to rest. When performing a rest, the hero recovers 
equal to their Endurance.
- If the hero recovers more  than the hero has suffered, the hero recovers one  for each  the hero
cannot recover. This rule is not in effect when playing a Legends of the Alliance campaign.
- When playing a Legends of the Alliance campaign, after rest a hero can spend one Medpac from the app to
recover 5.
Related Topics: Actions 4, Damage 24, Endurance 28, Recover 52, Strain 58

## RETRIEVING TOKENS

Some missions allow figures to retrieve specific tokens. A figure adjacent to or in the same space as the token
can perform an interact to retrieve the token. Place the token on the figure's base to mark that the figure is now
carrying that token. The token now moves with the figure.
- A carried token cannot be retrieved by other figures, traded to other figures, or voluntarily dropped.
- If a figure is defeated, any tokens that it is carrying are dropped in its space. This includes when a hero
becomes wounded or if the hero withdraws.
- Mission rules specify the effect and purpose of retrieving tokens.
- At the end of a mission, all carried tokens are returned to the game box.
- Retrieving a token is not claiming a token.

## REVEAL

When a rule or ability instructs a player to reveal a card, that player takes that card from its current location
(such as a player's hand or the top of a deck) and shows it to all players. After the rule or ability resolves, that
card is returned to that location unless it was otherwise affected by the ability.
Related Topics: Hidden Information 34

## REWARDS

At the end of each mission, a number of rewards are received by the Imperial and Rebel players. Some rewards
are received from mission results and are listed under the “End of Mission” section. Others are found in the
“Additional Rewards” section, and these are received in addition to those from “End of Mission”. During a
mini campaign, epilogues (see “Epilogues” on page 29) provide rewards specific to mini campaign progression.
Related Topics: Mini Campaigns 42, Mission Events 43, Mission Stage 46, Reward Cards 54

## REWARD CARDS

During a campaign, players can gain cards from the Reward deck. This deck contains Item cards and Class
cards that cannot be purchased and are usually gained only as a mission reward.
- Players always gain specific Reward cards from the deck.
- In a three-hero game, each player receives a "Heroic" Reward card at the start of the campaign. In a two-
hero game, each player receives a "Legendary" Reward card (see "Campaign Setup" on page 18).
- Players can look at cards in the Reward deck at any time.
- Heroes cannot give their Reward cards to other heroes, and cannot sell Reward cards.
Related Topics: Class Cards 19, Item Cards 38

## RUBBLE

When an ability or effect requires the placement of rubble, the player takes one of these tokens
from the supply and places it in the space directed by the ability or effect.
A space containing rubble is considered to be difficult terrain, in addition to its other terrain
types. The effect of rubble does not stack with the effect of preexisting difficult terrain.
A space can contain both rubble and an energy shield.
Related Topics: Difficult Terrain 27, Rubble 54, Terrain 60


## SKIRMISH

A skirmish is a special mission in which players build armies and compete to acquire 40 victory points. Rules
that specify "during a campaign" do not apply to skirmish missions.
The "Hoth Battlefield", “Nal Hutta Borderlands”, and “Temple Gardens” skirmish maps, found on the Skirmish
Map Sheet of Return to Hoth, Jabba's Realm, and Heart of the Empire expansions, allow four players to
compete in a massive Imperial Assault battle (“Four-Player Skirmishes” p.32). Depending on which mission is
played, the players could all compete against each other in a Free-For-All or in a Team Battle.
Before playing a skirmish, perform the following steps:
1. Bring Armies and Command Cards: To play a skirmish mission, each player needs an army consisting
of up to 40 points worth of Deployment cards and a deck of exactly 15 Command cards. Each player
places their Deployment cards faceup in front of him and shuffles their deck of Command cards. (See
“Army Building” p.9)
2. Determine Initiative: The player who has the lowest total cost of Deployment cards chooses which player
begins the game with the initiative token. In the case of a tie, players determine initiative randomly. The
player with initiative will choose deployment zones and resolve the first activation during the first round.
3. Determine and set up Skirmish Mission: The player with initiative shuffles their Skirmish Mission deck
(see, "Building a Skirmish Mission Deck" on page 6) and draws one card. This card lists the name of the
mission, which map it is played on, and the special rules for this mission.
After drawing this card, players refer to the matching skirmish mission diagram to build the map.
In tournament play the mission to play is determined according to the tournament rules.
4. Deploy Units: The player with initiative chooses one of the deployment zone shown on the skirmish
mission's diagram. If playing two-player skirmish, red or blue deployment zones are available. If playing
Four-Player Skirmish, also yellow and green deployment zones are available. The player with initiative
deploys all of their figures in the chosen deployment zone.
The player to their left does the same, choosing from the remaining deployment zones, and so on until all
players have deployed.
5. Draw Command Cards: Set the round dial to one. Each player draws three cards from their Command
deck (see "Command Cards" p.20).
Players are then ready to begin playing the skirmish.

## PLAYING A SKIRMISH

To play a skirmish, players follow all the basic rules used for playing a mission. Each round consists of an
Activation Phase, followed by a Status Phase. Note that the specific rules for these phases differ slightly from
the rules of a campaign mission.
- Activation Phase: Players first resolve any abilities that are triggered at the start of a round (for example,
mission rules from the Skirmish Mission card).
Then, starting with the player that has initiative, the players take turns activating deployment groups. If a
player has fewer ready Deployment cards than any opponent, that player can choose not to activate a group
and pass play to the next opponent.
Once all Deployment cards are exhausted, players proceed to the Status Phase.
- Status Phase: After all figures have been activated, players resolve the steps of the status phase in
preparation for the next game round. (see “Status Phase” p. 57).
These phases are repeated until the mission ends (see "Winning a Skirmish" p. 63).
The player with initiative breaks all ties for mission rules. For example, if a mission rule moves a token one
space toward the closest figure and there are two figures equidistant, the player with initiative chooses which
figure the token moves toward.
See special rules that apply for Four-Player Skirmish from page 32.

Mission Setup 44, Winning the Game 63


## SKIRMISH ATTACHMENTS

Some skirmish upgrade Deployment cards list the word "Attachment" above their abilities. These cards can be
attached to other Deployment cards as follows:
- When deploying units during skirmish setup, if a player has one or more "Attachment" cards included in
their army, the player places each of these cards on one of their non-upgrade Deployment cards.
- Each Deployment card can have only one "Attachment."
- Abilities on "Attachment" cards apply to all figures in the corresponding group.
- Many attachments require the group to have a specific trait, such as "TROOPER." Attachments with these
restrictions cannot be placed on a group that does not have the trait.
When the last figure of a group with an "Attachment" card is defeated, the opposing player scores VPs equal to
the deployment cost of the "Attachment" card in addition to the VPs scored from the defeated figure.

## SKIRMISH ROUNDS

In skirmish, some effects on command and Deployment cards refer to the number of the current round. Players
should keep track of the current round number. The round number advances during the Status Phase after step
3, “End of Round Effects”. (See “Status Phase” p. 57)

## SKIRMISH UPGRADES

See “Deployment Cards” p.26 and “Skirmish Attachments” p.56

## SMALL FIGURE

Any figure that occupies only a single space is a small figure. Some rules and abilities specify that they apply
only to small figures.
Related Topics: Large Figures 39

## SPECIAL SETUP

Many missions have special setup instructions covering rules such as Rebel ally usage or token placement.
- When the rules instruct to randomly place a number of specified tokens, the Imperial player collects the
listed tokens, shuffles them together, and places them facedown in the spaces indicated on the map. Until
revealed by mission rules, no player is allowed to examine the facedown side of these tokens.
- When the rules instruct to choose and place a number of specified tokens, the Imperial player collects the
listed tokens and places them facedown in any of the indicated spaces of their choice. Until revealed by
mission rules, Rebel players are not allowed to examine the facedown side of these tokens. After the tokens
are placed, they cannot be moved, but the Imperial player can examine them during the mission.
Related Topics: Mission Setup 44

## SPECTRE ALLIES

During the missions that make up the Tyrants of Lothal campaign, the Rebel players will be prompted to bring
a Spectre Ally. Spectre Allies are those allies with "Spectre" or “Chopper” in their subname, such as C1-10P
(CHOPPER), Kanan Jarrus (SPECTRE-1), and Sabine Wren (SPECTRE-5).
During campaign setup, when the hero players are choosing green side missions, they may choose more than
one mission that rewards “Any 1 Spectre ally.”
Related Topics: Allies 7, Minicampaigns 42, Unique 62


## STATUS PHASE

After each Activation Phase, players perform the steps of the Status Phase.

## STATUS PHASE IN A CAMPAIGN

During a campaign, the Status Phase consists of the following steps:
1. Increase Threat: The Imperial player increases the threat dial () by the threat level of this mission as
listed on the campaign log.
2. Ready: All exhausted cards except the cards of each hero are readied here. The Imperial player readies all
of their exhausted Class, Reward, and Deployment cards. Deployment cards of allies are also readied. Each
hero also readies all of their activation tokens by flipping them green-side faceup. Exhausted reward cards
that are not associated with any hero are also readied.
- Hero Class cards, Item cards, Reward cards associated with heroes, and associated Companion cards are
readied at the start of that hero's activation, not during the Status Phase.
3. Deploy and Reinforce: The Imperial player may perform an optional deployment (p.49). This allows him
to spend  (threat) to deploy groups and/or reinforce figures to place additional figures onto the map.
4. End of Round Effects: If there are any abilities or mission rules triggered at the end of this game round,
players resolve them at this time – mission rules first, then abilities from the imperial player, and abilities
from the rebel players.
- If playing with three heroes, a hero that has two activation tokens must give one of the tokens to another
hero of their choice at the end of each round.
5. Advance Round Dial: Advance the round dial by one. Then players begin a new round starting with a
new Activation Phase.

## STATUS PHASE IN A SKIRMISH

During a skirmish, the Status Phase consists of the following steps:
1. Ready Cards: All players ready all of their exhausted cards.
2. Draw Command Cards: Each player draws one Command card from their deck plus one additional card
for each terminal the player controls.
3. End of Round Effects: Resolve any abilities or mission rules that are triggered at the end of the round.
4. Pass Initiative: Increase the current round counter. The player who has the initiative token passes it to the
player on their left. Then players begin a new round starting with a new Activation Phase.

## STRAIN

Strain is shown as the  (strain) icon and represents the loss of willpower or fortitude. Many
game effects cause figures to suffer .

## STRAIN IN A CAMPAIGN

When a hero suffers , place an equal number of strain tokens on their Hero sheet. When any other figure
suffers , it suffers an equal amount of  (damage) instead.
- Heroes have many abilities that have  costs. These abilities require the hero to suffer  in order to use
the ability. (“Abilities” p.3)
- A hero can suffer 1 (strain) at any point during their activation to gain one movement point. The hero
may do this up to twice per activation. (“During Activation” p.28)
- A hero cannot choose to suffer  if the amount of  the hero has suffered would exceed their Endurance.
This includes suffering  to gain movement points or using abilities with a  cost.
- If an effect forces a hero to suffer  that exceeds their Endurance, the hero instead suffers one  for each
 the hero cannot suffer.
- A non-hero figure does not have Endurance and can choose to activate abilities with a  cost. When a non-
hero figure suffers , it suffers  instead.
- If an effect allows a hero to recover more  than the hero has suffered, the hero recovers one  for each
 the hero cannot recover. (This rule is not in effect when playing a Legends of the Alliance campaign.)
- If a Hero sheet ever contains strain tokens in excess of that hero's Endurance, such as when a hero becomes
wounded, the excess strain tokens are discarded.
- When a game effect mentions the amount of  a hero "has suffered," it refers to the total value of strain
tokens currently on their Hero sheet.

## STRAIN IN A SKIRMISH

In a skirmish, when a figure suffers , it suffers an equal amount of  (damage) instead. The player
controlling the figure can prevent any of this  by discarding one Command card from the top of their deck
for each  that they wishes to prevent.
Related Topics: Abilities 3, Damage 24, Endurance 28, Movement 47, Recover 52

## STUNNED

Stunned is a HARMFUL condition. A Stunned figure cannot voluntarily exit its space and cannot declare an
attack. A figure can resolve an attack that has already been declared if it becomes Stunned during it. A
Stunned figure can use the  specified on the Stunned condition card to discard the Stunned condition.
During a mission that allows escaping, Stunned figures cannot escape.
Related Topics: Conditions 22

## STYLE TOKENS

The hero Tress Hacnua uses style tokens to enhance her melee attacks and build to powerful
finishing strikes. These tokens have no inherent function and only interact with abilities found on
Tress Hacnua's Hero sheet and Class cards.
During campaign setup, when Tress Hacnua is chosen as a hero, place the two style tokens near her play area.
During a mission, Tress's abilities allow her to gain and spend these tokens for a number of beneficial effects.
The total number of style tokens that can be gained is limited by the included supply of two tokens.
Related Topics: Hero 34


## SUPPLY CARDS

During a campaign, a hero can interact with a crate token to claim the token and draw one Supply card. The
card is placed faceup in the hero's play area and can be used as instructed on the card.
- Most Supply cards are discarded after use.
- Supply cards cannot be traded to different heroes.
- During post-mission cleanup supply cards are shuffled back into the Supply deck, whether they were used
or not.
Related Topics: Claim 19, Credits 24, Crate Tokens 23, Mission Stage 46

## SURGES

Surges are attack results represented by  icons. Surges are gained during an attack and can be spent to
activate surge abilities from the weapon used for the attack, its modification, the hero sheet or hero class cards,
or from a non-hero figure's deployment or companion card.
- Each  (evade) result removes one  result at the end of the 4.Apply Modifiers step (see“Attacks” p.10).
Thus, each  reduces the number of  the attacker can spend by one.
- Each  ability can be triggered only once per attack.
- During a campaign, a hero performing an attack may spend 1 to recover 1.
- A  which is spent to activate an ability that relates to a keyword, such as Blast, Cleave, or a condition
keyword, adds the keyword during the Spend Surges step of the attack, but their effect is performed or
gives the corresponding condition after the attack resolves if the target suffered damage from the attack.
- Any  not spent during an attack are lost.
Related Topics: Attacks 10, Icon Types 35, Negative Symbols 48, Strain 58

## TARGET

When declaring an attack, the attacker chooses a figure or object to attack. This figure or object is referred to as
the target.
- If the target is a large figure, the attacker must target one space that the target occupies. This space is used
for determining line of sight and some abilities.
- If an ability refers to the target space, it is referring to the space occupied by the target. If the target is a
large figure, it is referring to the space chosen.
Related Topics: Attacks 10, Blast 15, Line of Sight 40

## TERMINAL TOKENS

Terminal tokens are placed on the map as indicated by the mission's diagram.
- In a campaign, terminal tokens have no inherent abilities and function as described in the
mission's rules.
- In a skirmish, each player draws one additional Command card during the Status Phase for
each terminal the player controls.
- Terminals do not block line of sight or movement. Figures can end their movement in the same space as a
terminal token.
- If a terminal is in a space containing terrain, the terrain in the space still takes effect. For example, a space
with blocking terrain that contains a terminal token still blocks line of sight, and figures cannot enter the
space.
- The colors of terminal tokens have no game effect unless specified by the mission.
- A terminal token with its colored side down cannot be examined by players. This color is hidden
information.
Related Topics: Control 23, Hidden Information 34, Interact 37, Objects 49


## TERRAIN

Some spaces have colored borders. The color and look of a border defines the terrain, which has special effects
on movement and line of sight.
- If a group of spaces is fully encompassed by a single terrain border or a combination of a single terrain
border and walls, each of those spaces is considered to contain that terrain type.
For example, each of the four spaces surrounded by blocking terrain on tile 01B (core set) contains
blocking terrain. These spaces are not adjacent to one another.
- Colored borders (in combination with walls) that do not fully encompass a space or group of spaces are
terrain edges. The terrain rules are only applied to the colored edge of this space and not the space itself.
- Tokens in a space have no effect on the space's terrain unless the rules for the token explicitly specify so.
- Solid red lines are blocking terrain (p.15).
- Dotted red lines are impassable terrain (p.35).
- Solid blue lines are difficult terrain (p.27). A space containing Rubble (p. 54) is considered to be difficult
terrain.

## TESTS

See "Attribute Tests" on page 14.

## TEXT BOX

The text box is the portion of a Companion, Deployment, or a Form card that includes specifically worded and
named special actions, surge abilities, and passive abilities.
Related Topics: Abilities Box 4, Form Cards 31

## THREAT

During a campaign mission, the Imperial player spends  (threat) to deploy groups (p.25) and reinforce
figures (p.53) to the map.
-  is set to 0 at the start of a mission. Special Setup during mission setup (p.44) can provide  and an
optional deployment. This also happens if the rebels choose an ally for a mission (“Rebel Allies” p.8).
- During the Increase Threat step of the Status Phase (p.57),  is increased by the mission's threat level
printed on the campaign log (p.17). Threat level is also frequently referenced to determine a particular value
in many missions. Remember the difference between the amount of  and threat level. Threat level is
usually constant during each mission.
- When  is increased or reduced, the Imperial player rotates the threat dial to display the new total.
- The Imperial player cannot have less than 0  or more than 20 . Any threat gained or lost beyond these
limits is ignored.
- The Imperial player cannot trigger an ability that costs more  than there is.

## THREAT MISSIONS

A threat mission is a type of mission used in the Return to Hoth campaign. These missions are set up following
the expanded "Campaign Setup" rules for this campaign. These missions function similarly to side missions,
except that they give the Imperial player access to Bane Reward cards, representing the wide variety of
problems facing the Rebellion in this era.
When choosing side missions during the campaign, the heroes will have to decide either to resolve these
lingering threats, or to follow their own side mission priorities. When the Rebels deal with one of these threats,
the fruits of their efforts are represented by Boon Reward cards.
Related Topics: Banes and Boons 14, Campaign Setup 18


## TILE TYPES

Each map tile in Imperial Assault has one or more tile types corresponding to the environment that tile
represents. Tile types have no direct gameplay effect but may be referred to by other components.
The primary tile type distinction is between interior and exterior ("Interior Spaces" p.37, “Massive” p.41).
Other tile types include forest, desert, snow, and city. (See “Habitat” p.33.)
- Forest:
- Core game tiles  01A-18A, 37A, 38B, and 39A
- Return to Hoth tiles 05A and 24A
- The Bespin Gambit tile 11A

Related Topics: Habitat 33, Interior Spaces 37, Massive 41

## TIME PERIOD

A campaign can be associated with a time period, represented by a number. This corresponds to a range of time
period values found on certain Side Mission cards and certain cards in Agenda sets. During campaign setup, set
aside any Side Mission cards whose range of values does not include the number associated with the campaign.
These cards cannot be included in the Side Mission deck.
- The time period of the core campaign is 3, the time period of the Return to Hoth campaign is 5. Other
campaigns do not have a time period.
- If a card in an Agenda set has a time period range that does not include the number associated with the
campaign, the Imperial player cannot choose that set when building their Agenda deck.
- If an Agenda set or Side Mission card does not have a time period displayed, it can be used in any
campaign.
Related Topics: Agenda Cards 6, Campaign 17, Campaign Setup 18, Missions 43


## UNIQUE

Each player can only use one copy of each unique card at a time. These cards are identified by a bullet (▪)
before the name, for example, "▪ Darth Vader."
- Unique cards are identified by name only. Sub-names, affiliations, and abilities are not taken into account
when determining which cards have the same name. For example, a player that has "▪ Luke Skywalker
HERO OF THE REBELLION" in play cannot deploy “▪ Luke Skywalker JEDI KNIGHT”.
Related Topics: Allies 7, Deployment Cards 26

## VICTORY POINTS

In a Skirmish, some abilities allow a player to spend their VPs or force their opponent to lose VPs. A player
cannot have fewer than 0 VPs and any VPs lost beyond 0 are ignored. When an ability instructs a player to pay
another player VPs, the paying player loses VPs and the paid player gains an equal number of VPs.
- If using an ability requires a player to pay more VPs than that player has, that player cannot use that ability.
- If a player's ability requires an opponent to pay more VPs than they have, that opponent pays all of their
remaining VPs.
Related Topics: Paying VPs 50, Winning the Game 63

## VILLAINS

All figures corresponding to unique Imperial ( or ) Deployment cards are villains. Villains follow all
general rules for allies listed on page 7.
Related Topics: Allies 7

## WALLS

Walls are solid black lines along the boundaries of map tiles. Figures cannot move or trace line of sight through
walls. See Appendix I – Line of Sight Example p.65 and Appendix II – Movement Examples p.67 for visual
examples of moving and tracing line of sight with walls.
- Walls are not terrain and are not affected by abilities that affect terrain. For example, Massive figures can
enter blocking terrain but cannot move through walls.
- Walls only block line of sight along an entire edge of a space. If a wall does not cover an entire edge, then
line of sight may be traced to, from, and through that edge or corner.
Related Topics: Line of Sight 40, Movement 47, Terrain 60

## WEAKENED

Weakened is a HARMFUL condition and applies -1 while defending and -1 while attacking.
Weakened is automatically discarded at the end of a figure's activation.
Related Topics: Conditions 22, Negative Symbols 48


## WINNING THE GAME

The rules for winning a game depend upon whether players are playing a campaign mission or skirmish
mission.

## WINNING IN A CAMPAIGN

The campaign consists of a number of linked missions. Each mission's objectives are listed in the mission's
rules in the Campaign Guide, usually as part of the “Mission Briefing”.
The player(s) who win the final mission win the campaign.

## WINNING A SKIRMISH MISSION

A two-player skirmish mission ends as soon as one player has accumulated 40 or more victory points (VPs).
The player with the most VPs wins the game. If all of a player's figures are defeated, the player loses the game
immediately, regardless of victory points.
A Four-Player (p.32) Free-For-All skirmish ends immediately when at least one player has gained 40 or more
VPs, at which point the player with the most VPs wins the game. The game will also end when three players
have been eliminated, at which point the remaining player wins the game.
A Four-Player Team Battle skirmish ends immediately when one team has collectively gained 60 or more VPs,
at which point the team with the most VPs wins the game. The game will also end when a pair of teammates
have both been eliminated, at which point the remaining team wins the game.
A player earns victory points (VPs) during a game each time the player defeats an opponent's figure or through
abilities or mission rules.
- When a figure is defeated, the opposing player scores VPs equal to that figure's Figure Cost (p.30).
- When the last figure in a group is defeated, if that group had an attachment, the opposing player scores VPs
equal to that attachment's cost.

## TIE BREAKERS

In the rare situation that both players have the same number of victory points at the end of the game, the player
with the most victory points from defeating hostile figures wins the game.
If the result is still a tie, each player counts the number of damage tokens on their remaining figures. Then, each
player adds the Health values of any defeated figures corresponding to Deployment cards still in their play area.
The player with the lowest total damage tokens and Health wins.
If players are still tied, each player rolls one blue die, and the player with the highest Accuracy rolled wins the
game.
Related Topics: Campaign 17, Defeated 24, Group 33, Skirmish 55

## WITHDRAW

During a campaign, when a wounded hero is defeated the hero withdraws. The hero is removed from the map
and cannot be activated for the remainder of the mission.
- The abilities on the hero's sheet, Class cards, Item cards, Reward cards, and Supply cards are not available
for the remainder of the mission.
- The player controlling the hero can still help the Rebel players make any group decisions as needed.
- If a player has an Ally's Deployment card in the mission, the player may choose to give it to the player
whose hero has withdrawn.
- Withdrawn heroes still receive all hero rewards at the end of the mission. If a hero withdraws during the
final mission, the hero still wins or loses the campaign with the rest of the Rebel players.
- A hero who has withdrawn remains wounded until the end of the mission.
- During post-mission cleanup, withdrawn heroes are no longer considered withdrawn. They perform all
normal "Post-Mission Cleanup" steps and participate in all future stages of the campaign.
Related Topics: Defeated 24, Mission Stage 46, Wounded 64


## WITHIN X SPACES

When the target of an ability is X or less spaces away from the figure having the ability, it is within X spaces.
A figure is within X spaces of itself. See "Counting Spaces" on page 23.

## WOUNDED

During a campaign, when a healthy hero has suffered  (damage) equal to their Health the hero is wounded.
The hero discards all damage tokens and flips their Hero sheet to the wounded side. If their  (strain) exceeds
their new Endurance value, the hero discards any strain tokens that exceed their Endurance.
- If a wounded hero is defeated, the hero withdraws (p.63).
- The wounded side of a hero sheet lists fewer abilities and often has lower Health, Speed, Endurance, or
Attributes.
- Once a hero is wounded, their sheet remains on the wounded side until the end of the mission.
- If a card or mission effect allows a wounded hero to flip their hero sheet to the healthy side during the
course of a mission, that hero is no longer wounded.

## XP

See "Experience Points" on page 30.
“YOU”
Many cards use the word "you" to refer to a figure instead of the player. For example, if a Deployment card
reads "While attacking, you may reroll 1 or more attack dice" each figure belonging to that card's group may
use that ability. If an ability requires “you” to exhaust the card, then only the figure paying the exhaust cost can
use the ability.
- If a figure's ability specifies “you” to choose something within a set number of spaces, players count spaces
(p.23) from the figure using the ability. Likewise, if an ability specifies “you” to choose an adjacent figure
or object, the figure or object must be adjacent (p.6) to the figure using the ability. If the ability requires
“you” to have line of sight (p.40), it is determined from the figure using the ability.
- If an effect corresponding to a figure instructs "you" to claim a token, gain VPs, or manipulate cards, or
refers to "your" army or figures, "you" refers to that figure's player.

APPENDIX I – LINE OF SIGHT EXAMPLES
- The part of a wall that partially extends into a space does not block line of sight or
movement. In this diagram, only the imaginary yellow lines along the edges of the
spaces (1) block line of sight and movement.
- Line of sight
can sometimes
be traced to a
figure (2) who
cannot trace it
back (3). The
lines cannot overlap (4).
- Line of sight (p.40) can be traced through the target (5).
Figures on opposite sides of the end of a wall have line
of sight to each other (6), but since the spaces are not
adjacent,  attacks cannot target each other unless the
attack has Reach (p.51).
- A figure can trace line of sight through itself and
through its target (7).
- Line of sight can be traced parallel along a wall (8),
blocking terrain space (9), door, or energy shield (not
pictured).
- Line of sight can be traced along the corner of a wall
(10), energy shield, or blocking terrain space (11) as
long as the line does not enter the blocking space or
energy shield, or cross through an edge completely
covered by a wall (p.62).
- Line of sight cannot be traced through doors (12), walls
(13), non-target figures (14), blocking terrain (15), or
energy shields (see p. 69).
- Line of sight cannot be traced through the diagonal
intersection of any walls, doors (p.27), energy shields,
or blocking terrain (16).
- Line of sight can be traced to and from the corner of a
figure and any combination of another figure (17),
wall, door, energy shield (p.29), or blocking terrain
(p.15).


- If the area between the line of sight lines contains a wall, door, energy shield, or blocking terrain, then the
figure does not have line of sight. Luke Skywalker does not have line of sight to the regular Stormtrooper.
- A blocking edge, door, or wall connecting the two chosen corners of the target space blocks line of sight if
it is between the target space and the corner from which line of sight is being drawn. Han Solo doesn't have
line of sight to the regular Stormtrooper.


## APPENDIX II - MOVEMENT EXAMPLES

- A figure can move diagonally past
blocking terrain (1), impassable
terrain (2), walls (3), and figures (4).
If there is a figure positioned
diagonally to the terrain, walls, or
another figure, this does not cost
additional movement points – only
the space the moving figure enters (p.29) affects the required
movement points.
- A figure cannot move through the diagonal intersection of any
combination of walls, doors, blocking terrain, or impassable
terrain (5).
- A large figure (a figure that occupies more than one space) can
move orthogonally (6) but cannot move diagonally (7). Note that
not all large figures ignore terrain, only figures that
have the Massive or Mobile keywords.
- Figures that occupy two spaces (8) and figures that
occupy six spaces (9) can rotate their bases 90 degrees
for one movement point. When rotating, a figure
cannot rotate into a position where it would occupy
less than half of the spaces it occupied before the
rotation (10).
- When a large figure is placed, either by deployment or
an ability such as "Pounce," locate a space (11)
indicated by deployment or the ability (for Pounce a
space within 3 spaces). One space of the large figure's
base is placed in the located space, and the remainder
of its base may be placed in any orientation relative to
that space (12), following placement rules (such as not
placing in spaces containing figures unless the figure
has Massive, or in spaces of blocking or impassable
terrain unless the figure has Massive or Mobile).
In this example the Nexu has Mobile, so when it
Pounces, one of its spaces need to be within 3 spaces
of any of its old spaces, and thus cannot be blocking
terrain, but any other spaces of the Nexu can enter a
space with blocking or impassable terrain.

APPENDIX III – BLOCKING TERRAIN EXAMPLES
If a figure or object occupies a space with blocking terrain, it is still possible to be adjacent and count spaces to
it (ignore the terrain of the target's space), and draw line of sight to the figure or object.
The terrain of each space is considered separately. The 4 spaces of blocking terrain in the example are not
adjacent to each other or any other space.
- If a figure occupies a space with blocking
terrain (1), you can draw line of sight to the
figure (by drawing line of sight to its space).
Luke can draw line of sight to the Probe Droid,
and the distance of the figures is 1. Also,
adjacent figures always have line of sight to
each other.
Luke cannot draw line of sight to the Jet
Trooper through the blocking space that is not
the target's space.
The Probe Droid can attack Luke, but not
Diala.
- The Jet Trooper is 2 spaces from Diala, but
Diala cannot draw line of sight (2) through a
non-target blocking space, through a non-target
figure, nor can two line of sight lines overlap –
in addition the lines are not to adjacent corners.
If Diala's weapon has reach, without the
Stormtrooper figure she would have line of
sight and could attack the Jet Trooper.
The Jet Trooper can attack Diala, but cannot draw line of sight through the space that has the crate
token.
- Diala is adjacent to the crate token, and thus is able to interact with it (3).
- Imperial Officer is adjacent to Probe Droid (4), so is able to use their Cower ability (“while adjacent to
a friendly figure”), if Luke Skywalker decides to attack him.
- The Royal Guard is adjacent to the Probe Droid figure, but is not adjacent to the space the Probe Droid
occupies (5), so the Royal Guard's Sentinel ability (“you are adjacent to the targeted space”) cannot be
used when the Probe Droid is attacked.
- Self-Destruct ability (“Each adjacent figure and object suffers”) of the Probe Droid would affect Luke
Skywalker, Imperial Officer, Jet Trooper, and Royal Guard, because they are adjacent to the Probe
Droid.
You cannot draw line of sight or count spaces to a space of blocking terrain, only to figures and objects on
blocking terrain. For example the target space for Pounce (“Place your figure in an empty space within 3
spaces.”) cannot be a space of blocking terrain although the other spaces the Nexu enters during the placement
of Pounce can be blocking or impassable terrain due to Nexu having the Mobile keyword. (See “Movement
Examples”, p.67.)
Blocking terrain placed between spaces (blocking edges) is not affected by figures or objects occupying spaces,
i.e. you cannot count spaces or draw line of sight through blocking terrain edges.


- Line of sight can be drawn to a
figure on blocking terrain. While a
figure occupies a space bordered on
all four edges by walls or spaces that
contain blocking terrain (such as in
tile  01B ”the Spire”), those
blocking terrain spaces can be
ignored when drawing line of sight
and counting spaces.
Both the elite Rebel Trooper and
elite Nexu can attack the elite Jet
Trooper. (See also Blocking Terrain
p.15.)
APPENDIX IV: ENERGY SHIELD EXAMPLES
Energy Shields block line of sight, but do not affect counting spaces or adjacency.
- A figure on a space that contains an energy
shield can draw line of sight out of the
space (1). The Probe Droid can draw line
of sight to the Rebel Saboteur.
- The diagonal intersection of any
combination of wall, door, blocking
terrain, or energy shield blocks line of
sight (2 - Stormtrooper).
The Imperial Officer cannot draw line of
sight through an energy shield.
- You can draw line of sight to a figure on
the same space as an energy shield (3), so
the Rebel Saboteur has line of sight to the
Probe Droid.
- Energy Shields do not block adjacency, so the Imperial Officer is adjacent to the Probe Droid.

## IACP Changes and Additions

The following are from **IACP Official Changes** and override or supplement the Consolidated Rules when applicable to Skirmish.

### Deplete (Skirmish Upgrades)

When a Skirmish Upgrade card is **Depleted**, the card is **removed from the game** (no longer in play). It is not readied at end of round. Treat it as a one-time use; the card is not flipped face down for the mission—it is gone.

### Figure Size (for effects)

- **Default:** If a Deployment card does not explicitly have LARGE or MASSIVE, it is considered **SMALL** for all effects (command cards, abilities, etc.).
- **LARGE:** 1x2 or 2x2 footprint (or explicit Large keyword).
- **MASSIVE:** 2x3 footprint or explicit Massive keyword.
- **SMALL:** 1x1 footprint or unknown.

### Passives / Keywords (IACP)

- **Priority Target:** Figures do not block line of sight for this figure's attacks.

### Skirmish Upgrades and Squad Upgrades

Skirmish Upgrades include figureless upgrades and **Squad Upgrades** (e.g. [Flame Trooper]): a type of Skirmish upgrade that adds or replaces a figure in a deployment group. The Squad Upgrade figure uses its own cost, health, and card abilities (IACP). Skirmish upgrades can enable multi-affiliation in army building where allowed.

# Command Card Data Conventions

When entering Command Card effects in `cc-effects.json` (via the review tool or editor):

## Effect text

- **Use full card text** — Type out the complete effect as printed on the card.
- **Traits in ALL CAPS** — Put trait keywords in all caps so they stand out and are easy to spot. Examples:
  - WOOKIES
  - Hunter
  - Droid
  - Rebel
  - Imperial
  - Leader
  - Elite
  - Trooper

This makes it clear which words reference traits vs. plain English, and helps with future parsing or tooling.

# High-res map PDFs

Place one PDF per map here. **Filename must match the map `id`** from `map-registry.json` plus `.pdf`.

Examples:
- `30th-floor-plaza.pdf`
- `anchorhead-cantina-bar.pdf`
- `bespin-tibanna-facility.pdf`

When a map is randomly selected in a game, the Board channel will post the PDF from this folder if it exists; otherwise it posts the Vassal image and a reminder to add the PDF.

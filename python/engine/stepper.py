"""D10 — headless action-application dispatcher.

`step(game, action) -> GameState` applies a single action to a game and
returns the resulting state. This is the inverse of the encoder: the
encoder turns a GameState into tensors for the net, the stepper turns
(state, action) back into new state for the self-play loop.

Unlike the JS handlers in src/handlers/*.js, this dispatcher is
headless: no Discord interaction, no UI message updates, no two-player
confirmation dances — just game-state transitions. The self-play loop
supplies actions from one side at a time, and the stepper advances
state accordingly.

Action space coverage is filled in incrementally. Unimplemented actions
raise NotImplementedError with a clear message so the self-play loop
surfaces gaps rather than silently producing wrong states.

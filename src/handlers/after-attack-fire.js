/**
 * Fire handlers for step-8 / after-attack-resolves effects.
 *
 * Each handler implements the actual application logic for one effect
 * type. Called from after-attack-resolve.js when the attacker (or
 * defender) clicks an effect's button in the post-resolve window.
 *
 * Effect types map to handlers via the `fireEffect` dispatcher:
 *   - 'recover'    → fireRecover    (heal attacker by N)
 *   - 'blast'      → fireBlast      (CRR step 8 splash; TODO follow-up)
 *   - 'cleave'     → fireCleave     (target picker; TODO follow-up)
 *   - 'condition'  → fireCondition  (apply 1 condition; TODO follow-up)
 *   - per-DC      → followup commits per ability
 *
 * Slice 2b first cut (this commit): only `recover` is wired live.
 * Other types throw a not-yet-wired error — they continue to fire via
 * the legacy inline-apply path inside applyDamageAndFinishCombat until
 * their follow-up commit migrates them.

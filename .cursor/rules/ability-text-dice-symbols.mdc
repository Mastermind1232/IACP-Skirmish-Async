# Ability text: spell out dice result types

When editing `abilityText` or `effect` in DC/CC data, **never leave a dice result as a blank or "the results"**. Cards show symbols; in plain text we spell out the result type.

- **Correct**: "Damage equal to the **Hit** results", "Strain equal to the **Surge** results", "Damage equal to the **Damage** results"
- **Wrong**: "Damage equal to the results", "suffers Damage equal to the ___"

Use the appropriate word for the die face: **Hit**, **Surge**, **Block**, **Evade**, or **Damage** (for "Damage results" on dice). If the card says "combined Hit and Surge results", keep that. Always fill in the specific result type the card refers to.

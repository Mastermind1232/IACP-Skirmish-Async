# Ability text: spell out dice result types

When editing `abilityText` or `effect` in DC/CC data, **never leave a dice result as a blank or "the results"**. Cards show symbols; in plain text we spell out the result type.

- **Correct**: "Damage equal to the **Hit** results", "Strain equal to the **Surge** results", "Damage equal to the **Damage** results"
- **Wrong**: "Damage equal to the results", "suffers Damage equal to the ___"

Use the appropriate word for the die face: **Hit**, **Surge**, **Block**, **Evade**, or **Damage** (for "Damage results" on dice). If the card says "combined Hit and Surge results", keep that. Always fill in the specific result type the card refers to.

# Populating DC figures from card images

## Never guess. Ever.

- If you are **not 100% sure** what the card says, **leave that field blank** (or leave the existing placeholder). The user will fill it in and can teach you so you read it better next time.
- You **must tell the user which fields or parts you were not 100% sure on**, so they know where you need help. List them explicitly (e.g. "Uncertain: defense die color, surge symbol in Flawless Execution").
- **Always use the best possible image recognition** when reading card images. These are playing cards with small text; low-quality or ambiguous descriptions are not a basis for filling in data.

## When you are 100% sure (reading guidance)

1. **Defense die:** White vs black are different; confirm from the card.
2. **Passives vs surge:** Passives = always-on. Surge abilities = spend surge for. Do not put passives in `surgeAbilities`. **Do not add passives unless the card clearly shows a passive**—if the card has no passives, leave `passives` out entirely. Never infer passives from stat-bar layout or guess. Do not add or edit `subname`; leave that to the user.
3. **Recover: Damage vs tokens:** Recover Damage (heart) = `recover 1`. Recover Block Token (shield) = `recover 1 block token`. Read the symbol.
4. **Ability text:** Spell out dice/symbol names (Hit, Surge, Focus, etc.) as in the first section above.
5. **Special actions:** Always check the card for the **special action symbol** (e.g. triangle / action icon). When an ability has that symbol, use the format **Special Action (Ability Name):** — not just **Ability Name:**. If you are not 100% sure whether an ability is a special action, leave the format as-is and list it in uncertainties.
6. **Tokens/symbols:** Surge (starburst) ≠ Focus (focus token) ≠ Power Token. **Question mark on a token background** = generic **Power Token** (player chooses any: Block, Hit, Surge, Evade, etc.). Write "gain 1 Power Token". Read the actual symbol.

# Trait and token wording (canonical form)

- **Heavy Weapon** — Always two words with a space. Never "HeavyWeapon" or "HEAVYWEAPON" in text; use "HEAVY WEAPON" (or "Heavy Weapon" where title case applies).
- **Force User** — Always two words with a space. Never "ForceUser" or "FORCEUSER"; use "FORCE USER" (or "Force User" where title case applies).
- **Power Token** — Always capitalized (both words). Even if the card uses lowercase, in our data use "Power Token". Never "power token" or "Power token".

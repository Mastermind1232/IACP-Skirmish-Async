# Ability text: spell out dice result types

When editing `abilityText` or `effect` in DC/CC data, **never leave a dice result as a blank or "the results"**. Cards show symbols; in plain text we spell out the result type.

- **Correct**: "Damage equal to the **Hit** results", "Strain equal to the **Surge** results", "Damage equal to the **Damage** results"
- **Wrong**: "Damage equal to the results", "suffers Damage equal to the ___"

Use the appropriate word for the die face: **Hit**, **Surge**, **Block**, **Evade**, or **Damage** (for "Damage results" on dice). If the card says "combined Hit and Surge results", keep that. Always fill in the specific result type the card refers to.

# Populating DC figures from card images

## Never guess. Ever.

- If you are **not 100% sure** what the card says, **leave that field blank** (or leave the existing placeholder). The user will fill it in and can teach you so you read it better next time.
- You **must tell the user which fields or parts you were not 100% sure on**, so they know where you need help. List them explicitly (e.g. "Uncertain: defense die color, surge symbol in Flawless Execution").
- **Always use the best possible image recognition** when reading card images. These are playing cards with small text; low-quality or ambiguous descriptions are not a basis for filling in data.

## When you are 100% sure (reading guidance)

1. **Defense die:** White vs black are different; confirm from the card.
2. **Passives vs surge:** Passives = always-on. Surge abilities = spend surge for. Do not put passives in `surgeAbilities`. **Do not add passives unless the card clearly shows a passive**—if the card has no passives, leave `passives` out entirely. Never infer passives from stat-bar layout or guess. Do not add or edit `subname`; leave that to the user.
3. **Recover: Damage vs tokens:** Recover Damage (heart) = `recover 1`. Recover Block Token (shield) = `recover 1 block token`. Read the symbol.
4. **Ability text:** Spell out dice/symbol names (Hit, Surge, Focus, etc.) as in the first section above.
5. **Special actions (mandatory per-ability check):** For **every** named ability on the card, check whether it has the **special action symbol** (triangle / action icon) next to its name. This check must happen for each ability individually — do not batch-skip it. If the symbol is present, use the format **Special Action (Ability Name):** — not just **Ability Name:**. Movement abilities (e.g. "Lift Off", "Jump", "Fly") are especially likely to be special actions — double-check these. If you are not 100% sure whether an ability is a special action, list it in uncertainties.
6. **Tokens/symbols:** Surge (starburst) ≠ Focus (focus token) ≠ Power Token. **Question mark on a token background** = generic **Power Token** (player chooses any: Block, Hit, Surge, Evade, etc.). Write "gain 1 Power Token". Read the actual symbol.

## Attack dice verification (mandatory)

When reading attack dice from a card image, follow this exact process:

1. **Count first.** Before identifying any colors, count how many distinct dice icons appear in the attack section of the stat bar. Write down the count (e.g. "I see 3 dice icons").
2. **Identify each.** Go through the dice left-to-right and name each color individually (e.g. "die 1 = red, die 2 = green, die 3 = yellow").
3. **Verify count matches.** Confirm the number of colors you listed equals the count from step 1. If it doesn't, re-examine — you missed one.
4. **Watch for yellow.** Yellow dice are the most commonly missed because they blend into card backgrounds, borders, or highlight elements. If you see only 2 dice on a card that costs 5+, double-check for a yellow die.
5. **Watch for blue vs green.** Blue and green dice are both cool-toned and easily confused at small resolutions. Blue is darker/cooler; green is lighter/warmer. If you see a "green" die, double-check whether it's actually blue, and vice versa.
6. **Cross-check against cost.** A unit costing 5+ with only 2 attack dice is unusual. If you see this, re-examine the image before committing.
7. **Never resolve uncertainty by reasoning.** If you are unsure whether a die is "red or blue" or "green or yellow", do NOT pick one based on what "makes sense for the card's design." That is guessing. Flag it as uncertain and tell the user. Only commit a color you can clearly see.
8. **If uncertain about count or color, flag it.** List it in your uncertainties — do not silently drop a die or pick a best-guess color.

# Trait and token wording (canonical form)

- **Heavy Weapon** — Always two words with a space. Never "HeavyWeapon" or "HEAVYWEAPON" in text; use "HEAVY WEAPON" (or "Heavy Weapon" where title case applies).
- **Force User** — Always two words with a space. Never "ForceUser" or "FORCEUSER"; use "FORCE USER" (or "Force User" where title case applies).
- **Power Token** — Always capitalized (both words). Even if the card uses lowercase, in our data use "Power Token". Never "power token" or "Power token".
